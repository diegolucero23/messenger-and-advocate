Boston, Nov. 23, 1844.

ELDER HARDY: Sir, I respectfully submit the following to your disposal, with the earnest wish to aid you in the equitable measure which you have adopted in exposing to the just detestation of a high-minded public, the promulgators of a system of extreme licentiousness, no less irrational in its nature, than that of the most depraved of the human race; although its preachers pretend hypocritically to have the sanction of heaven. All virtuous people will applaud the spirited exertions which you have made to open the eyes of those who may yet be ignorant of the contemptible measure adopted by certain individuals. not merely to screen themselves from merited punishment, but to carry out their darling projects, setting at defiance the laws of God and man, and outraging common decency. About two or three evenings prior to your trial (so called) Elder Freeman Nickerson met me in Suffolk Hall, and noticing my dejection of mind, said he should like to go home with me, as he had a good deal to say to me; as we walked along he said, among other things, "Brother Eaton, if I am called as a witness during Brother Hardy's trial I shall tell the truth; I suppose that I sl.all be cut off for it, I expect the whole branch will be cut off, but no matter if we are, we will all be baptized and enter into a covenant. Brother Smith no doubt will be dreadful mad with me for he has got an awful temper when it is up, but I am not afraid of him, or any other man; I never was; I am ready to lay down my_life for the truth. Well, Father Nickerson what kind of a character has William Smith sustained heretofore? "Don't ask me," said he! "I don't want to say any thing about it? I don't want to get into trouble, but I mean to tell the truth if I am called upon. Don't be worried, Brother Eaton, it will all come out right." After your trial, (so called,) I reminded Elder Nickerson of the conversation which we had together, and told him I did not know what to think of him; he said, "Oh, how I wished the other evening that I had been in Brother Hardy's place, I would have acknowledged that I had done wrong, and then all the trouble would have been settled." But, said. I, Brother Hardy is cannot make such an acknowledgment as that, because he thinks that he has done right; and Father Nickerson, you remember, what you told me the other night yourself about William Smith. Well," said he, "Brother Eaton, if we strike against our head we strike against ourselves," It is evident to my mind that Elder Nickerson has been overawed by William Smith, and made a convert to the pernicious doctrine that we must uphold the authorities of the church right or wrong, a doctrine which has paved the way to a most lamentable apostacy, with a large portion of the society, and led to turn the grace of God into lascivious-ness.

Respectfully,
JOHN A. EATON.

New York. Nov. 13, 1844.

ELDER HARDY: SIR, I have been informed that you are about to publish your trials, before the church, for slandering G. J. Adams, William Smith, and S. Brannan, in order to defend your own character against their malicious thrusts, and expose to public view the corruptions of these men, and a certain clique that are now attempting to sustain them. If these are the objects you have in view, I can sincerely say that I commend you for this praiseworthy undertaking, for certainly to expose the secret and most extraordinary system of wickedness carried on by professedly religious men, is the laudable duty of any man that takes the least interest in the welfare of mankind. I am pleased to see any man take a bold stand in favor of the truth, and in opposition to the most contemptible scheme of iniquity that has been introduced into the church during the last two or three years, generally known by the name of the "Spiritual Wife System," thus doing may be the means of guarding the innocent and unwary female against the unhallowed attacks of a set of libertins, and retrieve the honest and orderly portion of the church from the present state of disgrace to which these unsanctified excesses have reduced the whole society, and save them from a more horrible vortex of woe, that lies in the advance, yawning for heart-rending victims of dispair. So may-kind heaven protect you and crown your efforts, with signal success.

With regard to the course pursued of late by Elder S. Rigdon, I can say that if the book of Doctrine and Covenants is true, he, in respect to his general or public movements, has done nothing more than that which the Lord has commanded him to do; he seeks not to lead the members of the church from the original or true principles and order of the same, but is laboring to get them to return, (inasmuch as they have strayed from) and strictly adhere to them. Now, sir, I know that if what is written in the above book be true, he is the only lawful President of the church now living, and the only one holding the keys of the kingdom; and by the bye, it is said in this book, that he is equal, with Joseph Smith in holding them. It has been said that he is trying to build up a church on his own responsibility; this is utterly false; is only officiating in his proper office, and carrying out the true principles and order of the church: those who sustain him in this capacity, are sustaining this order; all that arrogate to themselves this office, are aspirants. and are acting without the sanction of heaven, and in opposition to the law of the church, and if the term apostate is applicable to any one, it is to those who have taken a stand against the proper authority or authorities of the church.

I have hitherto, and do now, give out the following as a standing challange: "This is

Indeed sir, they have publicly declared in
Nauvoo, that they would not only destroy
his influence, but that of all those that stood
by him: of course as they cannot use truth
to do this, they expect to invent and put in

## POETRY.

### A SONG OF ZION.
BY S. RIGDON.

The time is now coming the day is at hand,
When Zion in strength and in beauty shall
stand;
Awake from her slumbers, in glory arise,
And send her loud anthems to God in the skies.

Her beautiful garments, as brilliant as gold;
The splendor of which has never been told;
though held up to view in prophetic renown,
The head of all nature with glory to crown.

In strength, her foundations in firmness are laid,
And God in her midst, her glory and head,
With light, and with truth and with righteous-
ness, shine,
And wisdom, and grace, and with mercy divine.

From time immemorial, in prophetic lore,
She's been mark'd as the object of heaven's
kind care,
Her triumph and victory, the prophet's reward,
And Jesus her head, her king, and her Lord.

Her strength shall increase, with each rolling
year:
Her power and influence, in glory appear:
Her walls in great strength, exalted on high:
Her watchmen in wisdom, shall see eye to eye.

Her great ones in darkness no longer shall hall lay;
The light of their truth, shall blaze as the day:
To glory and rest they will point us the road;
For all of her children are taught of their God.

O Zion the glory, and praise of the earth;
Thy conquest is certain, from time of thy birth;
Though kingdoms and nations, in ruin are cast
Thy strength and thy power, increase to the
last.

Thy travail and sufferings shall not be in vain;
Thy children, in multitudes, 'engthen thy train,
In numbers, like sand that's spread on the shore,
Thousands and thousands of millions, and
more.

Thy peace like a river, in righteousness flow
Thy streams of salvation-all nations shall know;
The prince, and the peasant, the noble and
mean;
Find salvation in thee forever, amen.
