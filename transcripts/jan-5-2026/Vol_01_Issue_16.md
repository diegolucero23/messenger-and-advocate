# SERMON No. 2.
DEDICATED TO THE SAINTS OF THE LAST DAYS.

BY: S. RIGDON.

[Continued from page 229.]

Hebrews 2d chapter 6th verse: "What is man is that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?"

But to return and inquire What is man? We have ascertained that his history is lost in the past, we will now inquire what it is in the future. All we know or can know about of it we know by revelation, all beside that is to conjecture, and it is a matter of some consequence to distinguish between what we do know, and what we conjecture. There might be an exception made, taking that part of man's history embracing the period from his birth till his death. During this period of man's existence, we can learn some things otherwise than by revelation; but before and after that, revelation alone gives light, and if it does not, all is conjecture.

One fact is doubly known that man is doomed to die. This experience as well as revelation teaches us; but after death all we can know about him is by revelation; by revelation then we learn that the spirit still is in existence when the man is dead as well as when he is alive, and that it is capable of being tormented, and of being comforted, as when alive. But the few facts which we have in relation to this state of existence, to which all are destined, only create a desire in the mind for more. The man who has got revelation enough, on this period of man's existence, must have a mind that can content it self with terms only, regardless of all ideas. He may say the rich man was in hell and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom, but what is "hell, and what Abraham's bosom, is not revealed, but we have got the terms and that is revelation enough, we need no more, as many do say. If this is the hell where they say the wicked are to be eternally, and Abraham's bosom the heaven, then they must be very near together, within talking distance; but why multiply words about it. There is no man living, who believes the bible, but would desire more revelation in relation to this dark period in the history of man, and we strongly doubt whether any man can invent for himself a set of prejudices sufficiently strong to quiet all his desires, so, that if he would confess the truth, he would say he did desire moré revelation, and he had not enough to satisfy him, but believing that he can get no more he satisfies his mind the best way he can.

Who, that reflects at all, but will, in his meditations, wonder if these disembodied spirits have a planet some where in the bounds of creation on which they dwell, that man is as well suited to their condition as this one to ours, and that on that planet, as on this, the inhabitants can be comforted and tormented; and in it there is an Abraham's bosom and a place of torment; nothing but a stupid system of religion could keep the mind of man from desiring to follow his history in this dark period of his existence; but, say those whose religion is founded on principles that would repel with indignation a messenger of heaven sent to enlighten them, we need no more revelation; but a mind delivered from such ignorant prejudices, would desire revelation on every point where there is darkness, when it is his own future condition after and which ho is searching.

There are some things said in the conversation above quoted between Abraham and the rich man, that strikes the mind with great force. The rich man requests Abraham to send Lazarus to his five brethren, and warn them that they come not to that place of torment. Now why. warn them in this world, unless there was something they could do in this world, that would effect their condition there, and a something that could not be done there. Lazarus could not administer to the comfort of the rich man there, but he could make something known to his (the rich man's) brethren who were here in the flesh, that if they would hear and obey, would keep them from the place of torment where the rich man was..

From this we learn an important fact, that men can do something in this world which has an effect on their spirits in their disembodied state, and by reason of something they do here, their spirits are comforted, and by the reason of not doing it their spirits are tormented when separated from the body. Were this not the case, why did the rich man desire that Lazarus might be sent to his five brethren, lest they should go to the place of torment where he was? no other reason can be assign ed for this request only, that by their hearing and obeying the message it would effect their peace and happiness, in that invisible world. But all the light we have in relation to this important period in man's history, is not sufficient to satisfy the mind even of those who say they have revelation enough and need no more; but here, again, all the powers of con-

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

PITTSBURGH, PA. JULY 1, 1845.

It is to us, a matter of great satisfaction, to see how the cause of truth moves on quietly, and peaceably, without excitement or confusion. Truly, it is said that the Lord is a God of order and not confusion. He dwells only where there is order. Where confusion reigns there the Lord is not; it is so with individuals as with his church; whenever the mind of an individual gets into disorderand confusion, the Lord ceases to communicate to or with that person, because the Lord does not dwell in the midst of confusion. How-frequently we see those who profess to serve the Lord, in darkness and fear, not knowing what to believe nor what to do. All is wrong; but why is it so? the Lord is the same. The answer must be the person has got out of his place, and the Lord will not follow him; had he staid with where the Lord had placed him, and by so doing, kept his own heart right before the Lord, there would have been no darkness in his mind. Darkness in the mind of a saint, is always the result of error committed by him.

Though persecution rage, and iniquity prevail, yet, if a man's heart is right in the sight of God, he will have no darkness in his own mind; between him and his God it will be peace.

Let those who belong to the church of Christ remember this, and it will relieve them from many hours of uncalled for anxiety. If all the world are wrong, and are in confusion, he who keeps his heart right before God will be at peace; his mind will not be darkness but light, not confusion but peace: and no darkness comes on the mind of a saint when he is standing in the place where the Lord placed him; for in that place the Lord will commune with him. Whatever place or calling is-assigned to a man in the kingdom of heave: is the place and the only place where the Lord will commune with that person, and out of that place he will find confusion and darkness, and though åll rejoice he will be in trouble, and all are in light he will be in darkness.

All that the saints have to do, is to keep their hearts right before the Lord, and he will see to them, and bear them off triumphant in fall things pertaining to his kingdom.

was every way suited to the end for which it was introduced, Peter say verse 39, "For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call," that is the promise of "the gift of the Holy Ghost," which Joel had said, would be a power by which they could prophecy, see visions and dream dreams.

What then can be more clearly set forth than the fact, that the gospel proclamation was predicated on the capabilties of man to hold communion with God. It was to be so with man through all time; the promise was not only to the children, of those who were present; but to all that were afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call. So that men, according to this, were to be the same through all time; all were to be capable of receiving the Holy Spirit, and if to receive the Holy Spirit, to prophecy, see visions, &c. and what adds to this, is, that it was the promise which was made to the obedient. Now take away the promise and what avail is the remainder. What advantage in faith, repentance, and baptism? none surely only as they brought the person, who was the partaker thereof, into a near relation with the Deity, by which he could obtain communication with God, and be a sharer in his [God's] wisdom, prudence and power, by which salvation comes.

The account given us of the execution of the high commission given to the apostles, as quoted above, goes to comfirm what we have said, if it needs confirmation, and shews that others besides the apostles had this same power of holding communion with God by obedience to the gospel. The case at Samaria is to point. Philip had gone there; and when he had preached unto them, and the people believed, he baptised them both men and women; and the apostles, when they heard of it, they "sent Peter and John" who when they arrived, "prayed for them and laid their hands-on them and they received the Holy Ghost," that is, the men and women who had been baptised at Samaria. Just as Peter had said on the day of Penticost, they who obeyed should receive the Holy Ghost."— Thus carries the truth of what Peter said to its utmost limits. In this instance both men and women were made partakers of the "Holy Ghost" by obeying the gospel; this shews that both men and women possess the same powers of holding communion with God, and obtaining wisdom and power with him, Peter said on the day of Penticost, that when the Lord, in the last days, poured out his spirit on all fresh, their sons and their daughters should prophecy, and the servants and handmaidens; and at Samaria it was confirmed, both men and women received it; abiding evidence that all both men and women are capable of having power with God, and wapa-le of being saved, as the gospel proposed to so save only on the principle of receiving the Holy Ghost."

To be conchided in our next.

## ESSAY ON THE PROPHESIES AND COMING EVENTS.

[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 231.]

The Lord has set his hand again the sec. ond time to recover the remnant of his pen ple, accordi. g to Isas'. prophesy Fith chaper 11th verse and is beginning to restore cur judges as at the first, and counsellors as at the beginning." See Isaiah Ist chapter 26th and to 27th verses, "And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the -beginntog: afterwards thou shalt be called and The city of righteousness, The faithful city. Zion shall be redeemed with je dament, and her converts with righteousness." By the above we learn that Zion will be redeem ed with jueganent, and her converts with righteousness, or in other words, every thing that can be shaken will be taken out of the way, that the Kingdom which cannot be sha-ter ken may remain. One may be ready to ask the question, how was Israel's judges at the first? the answer is they had a Moses and his counsellors; they also had 70 Elders which constituted the executive department in their ecclesiastical government, this restitution thus far has taken place. Christ compared the Kingdom of heaven to a net cast into the sea, which gathered of every kind both good and bad. It bedome neccessary that this gather-iug should take place in order to obtain a suf-ficient nun ber of tried and chosen ones to or-ganize the Kingdom. The principle of chos ing is the same now as it was when Moses said to the children of Israel, choose ye this day whom ye will serve. See also Book of covenants 5th sec. 2d paragraph; "Be-hold here is wisdomlet every man choose for himself until I come."

The reader by this time may be ready to im-agine whether the Lord has promised to send a man like unto Moses, to rule over his house-hold to prepare the Bride for his coming.-God has-promised that Zion shall travail and bring forth her children in the last days. the nations be, that fight against mount Zi-Shall she have a leader? See Isa 66th Chap-on"
ter. 7th verse "Before she travailed, she Isa. foresaw that nations would rise to fight brought forth; before her pain came, she was against Mount Zion: and he likened them to * delivered of a man child." Compare the a- the dream of a night vision; if a man dream-bove with Malachi 3d Chapter 1st verse.- eth he eatheth and awaketh and is hungry, or

And Main the last war? it was unto them as the 24th chapter 45th 46th and 47th verses.- dream of a night vision.
Who then is a faithful and wise servant, If England should become confederate with whom his lord hath made ruler over his house- all the allied powers and come to war against hold, to give them meat in due season?

Verily I say un- Prophesy of John, and Daniel and other pro-to you, that he shall make him ruler over all phetic declarations.

This goods. And you will find the Lord has promised to apprint a servant to rule over his houselfold, or a man child to lead Zion, or messenger to prepare the way before him that the Bride may make herself ready for the, Marriage Supper. And Moses placed the Shepherd the stone of Israel in the tribe of oseph. St Paul informs us that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing in particular concerning Priest-hood. The Kingdom of heaven will go out to meet the. B Bridegroom at his coming; and no doubt they will have Malachi's Messenger to head, with their their judges restored as at the first, and their counsellors as at the beginning.-They not only have a promise leaper like unto Moses, but a multitude of others. The Lord has promised to send for many hunters, as you will see in Jeremiah 16th chapter 16th verse. See also Rev 17th chhapter 14th verse. And they that are with him are called, and chosen, and fithful. See also Isa 13th chap-ter 3d verse. "I have commanded my sanc-tified ones, I have also called my mighty ones. See Joel 2d chaqter 2d verse. "A his great People, and strong there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be to the years of their many generations." I might quote a multi-tude of passages on this subject, but I think th the above sufficient to show that Isaiah's judg-es and counsellors will be restored, preparato-ry to the coming of Christ. We have proved in the former part of this treatise, that North America is the mount Zion. We believe also, or that the Most High established a free govern-ment here, in order to bring about his own purposes. See Isa 29th chapter 7th and 8th verses. "And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight a-gainst her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night-vision.-It shall even be as when a hungry man dream, eth, and behold, he eatheth: but he awaketh-and his soul is empty, or as when a thirsty. man dreameth, and behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all.

# See Micah 4th chapter 11th and 12th verse

Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. But they know not the thought of the LORD, neither understand they his council: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor."

When the allied powers cone and make war with the Daughter of Zion, they will be overcome according to Johorand Dantels Prophecy, then will the Daughter of Zion by way of reciprocity return the compliment.

Having shown that the Kingdom of Heaven would be set up in the last days, with the Ephramites God's, first born and also foundly them in Isaiah's far country. We shall endeavor to follow their fatrand see if they cross the seas when they go to Jerusalem to meet the bridegroom at his coming. See Zich. 10th chapter from the 6th to the 12th verse inclusive.

"And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them, for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though of I had cast them off, for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them. And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. I will hiss for them; for I have redeemed them: and they shalf increase as they have increased And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.

I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them. And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and, the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. And I will strengthen them in the Lord; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD,"

In the 9th. verse, the Lord says, they shall remember me in far countries; atid they shall live with their children and türn again.-

In the 11th verse. And he shall pass through the Sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves of the Sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up. Compare this with Isaiah 18th chapter ist verse. "Wo to the land Shadowing with wings which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, that sendeth Embassor-ders by the sea, in vessels of bull rushes (or as some translators say rushing vessels)."

See also Isaiah 11th chapter from the 10th to the 16th verse inclusise.

"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious. And it shall come to

# pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his

hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and, from Pathres, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, aud from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. And he shall set up an ensign for he nations, and shall assemble the o-entcasisf Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. The envy also of Ephriam shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be out off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephriam. But they shall foundly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together; they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon hallobey them. And the Lord shall utterly estroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea: and with his mighty wind shall he s' ake his hand over the river, sod shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry shod.-

And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt."

By the above quotations we have found that Judah and Ephraim will become reconciled to each other, and the Lord says as we for before quoted in Joel that when he brings again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, he will also gather all nations; and bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat. We have shown the means the Lord will make use of to gather the natious. Zachariah informs us that they will pass through the Sea with affliction, and smite the waves of the sea; and the deeps of the rivers shall dry up.

Since I left Pntsburgh, on the 14th ult. I have enjoyed as good health, or better, than is usual for me at this season of the year. I will give you a brief sketch of my journal since I bowed a farewell to you as the steamer was leaving the wharf of the Iron-but burnt city, to bear to with others to the bosoms of our dear families in the far distant west.

I remained (together with my brethren,) on the steamer Yucatan until we arrived in Louisville, Ky. the Captain, of which treated us very kind'y indeed. There were a great many passengers on board bound westward. to hunt newhomes in the vast widerness of prairies that lie stretched out there inviting, by all the richness and luxuriance of their soil and foliage, to settle on their bosoms and make tiomes. O! if they but know the troubles that were ahead of them their glee and song of "westward ho," would cease, and sorrow and mourning would fill their souls
