MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

PITTSBURGH, DECEMBER 2, 1844.

## A CIRCULAR.

FROM THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LAT-TER DAY SAINTS, IN PITTSBURGH, TO THE SAINTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

Beloved Brethren:—We, who have embraced the new and everlasting covenant, have been called to mourn on account of the cruel and horrid murder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, our former prophet and patriarch, whom God raised up to lay the foundation of his work in the last days. Yet we are again called to witness another event more painful; that of disunion, which must result in the final overthrow of all who adhere to principles and doctrines contrary to godliness. Yes, dear brethren, ere the mangled bodies of our brethren were cold in death, we hear men begin to cry We are the head! We are they who will guide the ship over the boisterous ocean. We are the individuals on which Elijah’s mantle has fallen. We are they who now stand at the head of God’s people to guide them to the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world; in short, we are they whom God has appointed to finish the great work of restitution which was commenced by Joseph. Now dear brethren, inasmuch as we know that the gospel is true, and that we have been made partakers of its blessings and the powers of the world to come, and have drunk of the pure spirit of liberty and truth, let us continue in that truth which alone makes us free; and then, divisions, disunion, strife and hatred is not known, because we see eye to eye, and our bodies are full of light, which light will guide our feet and cause us to love one another with pure hearts fervently. Yes brethren, let us cherish & uphold that principle, system or plan by which this love, joy, peace and comfort is to be obtained; for whenever the fountain dries up, the soul becomes thirsty, and it withers and dies; but when the fountain is open, we drink the living water which springeth up into eternal life. The God of Abraham said to Daniel that he would set up a kingdom that should never be thrown down, that it should not be given to another people but should stand forever. Are you in this kingdom, brethren, that shall fill the whole earth? and do you bring forth the fruits of the kingdom, and do you yield that obedience which is the essence of liberty—by which you can say in truth that the Lord is true, that his ways are equal, and have you planted in your hearts the faith that his kingdom will stand and become universal over all the earth? If you have, happy are ye—if ye have not you do not believe the testimony of his servants and are not partakers with the saints in light. The Saviour said, “though heaven and earth pass away not one jot or tittle of my word shall fail or pass away.” The same Jesus said that ye cannot serve two masters; for either ye will hate the one; and love the other; or else ye will withhold to the one, and despise the other. Did the loving Jesus speak the truth in this case? You will say most assuredly he did. Well, then, suppose that two individuals contended together concerning an apple; one says it is not an apple but a peach, while the other says it is an apple. Could you believe them both? Certainly not. Could they be both right and differ also. You say, truly it could not be possible.

If this reasoning is correct it follows as a matter of course, that if the twelve are to guide and direct all the affairs of this last kingdom, and are rightful heirs to fill that office, they who dissent from them are not citizens of the kingdom, and consequently cannot be right, and cannot be called saints. So also, on the other hand, if they who do not adhere to the twelve are right, they who do must be wrong. This is the true criterion, according to Jesus. Now, beloved brethren, let us in the fear of God, try to do right, for no man can do anything against the truth, but for it. But if we are without a criterion to direct us, we are of all men the most miserable. Let us take the word of the Lord for our judge in this matter and contend for it, though thousands do not. In our book of covenants the Lord makes known the order of his kingdom, and if we find the adherents of the twelve sustaining that order, let us uphold them in all righteousness; and on the contrary, should we find those who dissent from them to sustain the order of heaven pointed out in the book of covenants, let us sustain and uphold them; for there is no such thing as neutrality in God’s kingdom. If the Lord God serve him, but if Baal, serve him. We now appeal to that book for the true order, and pray God, our Heavenly Father, that we all may set aside all our prejudices and whatever may have a tendency to swerve us from an impartial and correct judgment in this matter. Let peace on earth and good will toward men be our motto.

In the third section of the book of Covenants, after explaining the nature and order of the Melchisedek and Aaronic priesthood, which are recognized in the church of God, we have set before us, in the 11th and 12th verses or paragraphs of said section, in language too plain to be misunderstood, the order which the Lord deemed necessary to plant in his church.

There is therefore no rational hope, that we can ever attain a preparation to stand in the presence of God, other than the way he has himself established for that purpose.

In vain is it to talk of building a house to the most high God, where his ordinances may be administered, and his glorious voice may be heard, when the very means by which alone these blessings can be legally obtained, are annihilated. Who is to administer the ordinance of the washing of feet? the first presidency; whose prerogative is it to receive the word of the Lord to the church? the first presidency.

But it belongs of right to those, who have discarded the first presidency, to find some legal way of trying a bishop, other than the only way by which God says he can be tried.

Sec. 22. As also, who has a legal right to this bishoprick, for the Lord says he must be designated by, and ordained under the hands of the first presidency, and no other way. If any thing were wanting to shew the unavoidable confusion, disaster and ruin, which the abrogation of the first presidency involves, surely this must supply the deficiency.

There is then no shadow of justification to be found in the revelations of Jesus Christ, for this fatal departure from God and righteousness, the excision of the first presidency. And the blind, ignorant, and arrogant assumption of the prerogatives of presidency of the whole church, by the quorum of the twelve, is alike destitute of warrant from sacred writ.

The only show of justification they profess to find in the law of the Lord, so far as we know, is in the third section where it is said that the twelve foran a quorum, equal in authority and power, to the three presidents; where it states, the same thing of the seventy, and shows precisely in what sense they are all equal, the three presidents, the twelve travelling counsellors, and the different quorums of the seventies; hear it all ye honest men. "And every decision made by either of these quorums, must be by the unanimous voice of the same, that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decision in * order to make their descisions of the same power and validity one with the other." It is then the unanimous decisions of the quorum of the twelve, and the quorums of the seventies, that make those decisions of equal power and validity with the decisions of the presidency, and these decisions must respect matters -which appertain to the duties of their calling. Moreover these decisions must be made in righteousness, that is according to the law of God; or they can effect nothing. Surely this is a perilous foundation for such a structure!

But the strong point, as they seem to consider it, is the assertion, that Joseptr laid the burden of the church upon their shoulders, addressing the twelve, telling them, he had given then all the keys he himself possessed, or knew any thing about. We neither admit

nor deny this, it is a matter we care nothing about; we do know verily, that Joseph taught contrary doctrine, from the conclusion which they presume to-draw from these declarations.. We have a surer test by which to try this matter, a touchstone that can be relied upon, that will not fail us. If Joseph Smith did really design to confer the auth rity to lead and preside over the church (which we have the best reason to doubt.) upon the quorum of the twelve; we say he did that which he had no power or authority from God to do; for the very obvious reason, that the God of truth, is not the author of two antagonist propositions, regarding the control, management, and economy of that order of things which he has established for the last time.

If the great God has revealed to us the organization of his church, and commanded it to be written for our guidance and instruction, challenging our implicit obedience. Who was Joseph Smith? or who is any other man? or set of men? that they can alter the decree of Jehovah? Woe be unto them if they attempt it, they wage an unequal warfare.

If Joseph Smith did design any such thing, he did that which hastened his destruction.-
But we said, we had the best reasons to doubt any such design, on the part of Joseph Sinith. It is a well known fact, that Hyrum Smithand - Sidney Rigdon, were both ordained by Joseph, as prophets, seers, and revelators for the church; it is also equally well known, that Joseph's preference was in favor of his brother Hyrym, as his successor in case of his death; and that he labored under undue and unjust prejudice, with regard to Sidney Rig-don, this he admitted himself publicly. Now if Joseph did design Hyrum as his successor, he did not design to dispense with the first presidency. We make these remarks to shew the very great improbability, to say the least, that Joseph Smith ever had any such design, as is imputed to him. The question of moment with us to decide is, what the Lord has designed, and determined on this subject;-
and we are among the number who believe, that he will accomplish his purposes, in any event; and in spite of the efforts of man to the contrary. If this view of the subject be correct, then we may rest assured that whatever the result has been, it was in accordance, with the purposes of the Almighty. Was Joseph Smith the called of God to lay the foundation of the church of God of the last dispensation? He was. Then the Lord has not been overreached, by a set of ungodly mobocrats; and he has still on the earth, a man olding equal authority, to carry on his work; in verification of his promise, that he would plant another in his, Joseph's, stead.

There is another fril prop, app ied as a support to the tottering fabrics That after the crucifixion of our Savior, the twelve took the presidency and control of the church; we think there is abundant evidence, that Peter

James and John constituted the presiding three; and that their places were filled in the quorum of the twelve by others. Be that as It may, it is a matter with which we have nothing to do. We have the law and organization of heaven given to us, by adhereing to which we shall acquit ourselves like men of God; or by the transgression of which, we shall be condemned. There is another important circumstance connected with this affair, which we must think, developes are: determination on the part of the twelve to seize the reins of government, law or no law. Sidney Rigdon and Amasa Lyman, are acknowledged by the twelve as having beer ordained first presidents; which of course would constitute a majority of the quorum and competent to do business; only requiring the addition of one member, to fill the vacancy occasioned by Joseph's death. It was an egregious inconsistency, to admit, that Sidney Rigdon and Amasa Lyman were legal members of the quorum of first presidency, as according to the book of Covenants, (see section 3rd,) they would constitute a quorum to do business.

"A majority may form a quorum when cireúmstances gender it impossible to be otherwise." In direct violation of this, and the multiplied provisions of the law of the Lord, the twelve admit their presidency, and deny their right to preside! Presidents! and no presidents!! We cannot call this by any better name than buffoonery. We think if any thing could betoken, a preconcerted resolution to destroy the first presidency, this must surely indicate it. But we are not left in the dark on this subject, we have before us cónclusive, evidence that it was determined by the twelve, before any action was had by the church at Nauvoo, to supplant Sidney Rigdon in the presidency. We say it was a gross imposition upon common sense. to make the admission, that they were both first presidents, and then request them to stand the one on the right hand of the twelve, and the other on the left. So it seems in the estimation of these men, a matter of small consequence, whether the church has three, twelve, thirteen, fourteen or more heads!

In no circumstances, we contend, could the order of heaven exist without the first presidency. If the Lord should take from the earth, all who held that authority, there would be no ground of hope, to the people destitute of that presiding power, for the attainicent of the rest of God; and still another dispensation must be ushered in, by which alone that glorious object could be accomplished. We do however werily believe, that the Lord will surely perform that which he has promised, that "The keys of the kingdom of God are committed to man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, or the stone which is cut out of the mountains without hands, shall roll forth until it has filled the whole earth," If Joseph

for a hundred other prophets, should transgress the law of the celestial kingdom, the great God holds their destinies in his hands, and will not suffer them to be cut off from the earth, till they, have first confered their authority upon others; and those too, individuals whom the Lord shall choose for that purpose.

It is perfectly ridiculous for certain men to say, that they have no confidence in Sidney Rigdon as a revelator; do they dare to contend with Omnipotence? The Lord says, (section 84,) that Sidney Rigdon is equal with Joseph Smith, in holding the keys of this last kingdom; and in 1841, the Lord commands Joseph to ordain him as a prophet, seer and revelator; (see Times and Seasons,) and in January of that year, (see new edition book of Cov. page 411,) the Lord says he as gisen Sidney Rigdon, as one of the quorum of first presidency, to receive the oracles for the whole church. This is worthy of note, as these men, who are so wise in their own conceit, say, he has been asleep for the last five years.

We presume if they will refer to the revelation published in the Times and Season, in the account of Sidney Rigdon's trial, (so called,) they will find, where he has been during that time; and where the Lord is placing him now. That like a faithful God as he is, he is plucking him out of deep mire, and exalting him on high. But Joseph asserted, so iris said by the twelve, that Sidney Rigdon would lead the church to the devil. Where, we would ask in the name of God, and in the name of common sense, is the spiritual wife revelation leading them? Has not the result proven that God was wiser than men. That he knew well, who would withstand the introduction of those doctrines of demons, which would inevitably lead those who adhered to them to destruction? Surely it has. Whenever we find men, no matter what their pretentions may be, quarrelling with the choosings and ordinations of God, we are sure they have then lost the spirit of God. "Many are called but few are chosen."

What an awful condition we should have been placed in, if no man had been found, having anthority to lead us into paths of righteousness.

How could we have certainly known, that Joseph Smith had transgressed, so as to forfeit his standing before God, but by his being cut off from the earth. There he was, the instrument whom God had chosen, by whom he had revealed his will, through whom the everlasting gospel saluted our ears and rejoiced our hearts, by whose instrumentality the book of Mormon was brought to light, and translated by the power of God; administered to, and ordained under the hands of heavenly messengers; declared by the voice of Jehovah to be in his hands, and that he alone could call him to account; with the promise of Him

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.
PITTSBURGH, PA. DECEMBER 2, 1844

The Editor being necessarily absent, is not responsible for the matter-contained in this number. Should any thing objectionable, therefore, appear, we trust our friends will attach no censure, or blame to Prest. S. Rigdon.

We have thought proper to date this number on the 2nd of De instead of the 15th of Nov., as we were unavoidably detained several days in geting our office prepared, as soon as we had anticipated. All things are in readiness now, however, and we feel cofident, that with the blessings of heaven, we shall be able to furnish our subscribers with the paper regularly hereafter.

E.

We would say to our friends, at a distance, who wish to subscribe for this paper, they can do so, by handing a $1 bill current money, to the Postmaster of their place, giving him the directions where, and to whom they wish the paper sent, who will remit the money to us free of expense, as it is the lawful privilege of every Postmaster to remit money to an Editor, for a third person, free of charge.

By pursuing the above course, our friends will save themselves a considerable expense.

We perceive by the published debate of G. J. Adams, (in the New York Prophet,) with Origen Bachelor, that the said G Adams enumerates as one of his impregnable positions, that the church of Jesus Christ is the same in every age; the same faith, the same officers, the same gifts, and the same blessings." What a striking commentary this upon the proceedings at Nauvoo! What marvellous consistency in the course this gentleman has pursued!! How admirably He carries out his principles!!! .

Our intelligence from various parts of the country is very cheering, and shows a disposition on the part of the honest in heart, to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints-a determination to adhere to the principles of virtue, as taught in the revelations of God and to cleave to the order of heaven, by which the church was organized in the last days. Knowing that if that order is violated, all must soon become confusion, and sectarianism will be the result.

A Brother in Ohio, writes: "I have received your paper, which if you continue to publish, I have no doubt will setule the minds of the honest hearted saints from the perplexing difficul

of Latter Day Saint the synonym, of treachery and debauchery. But thanks to the tender inercies of our God he has reserved a set of men, who have not bowed the knee to this adulterous Baal; who will not hold their peace, who will never relinquish the task, which they have undertaken, but with their lives, who with unwavering un-ceasing effort, will bear aloft the banuer of truth, virtue and integrity, nothing doubting, that the God of Israel, will be their safeguard and portion forever.

If it could be a matter of doubt, with any individual, who is not caught in the snare of the devil. by a practical adoption of the doctrine of polygamy, as taught by the apostales at Nauvon, the test given by the Son of God. that "a tree is known by its fruit," would afford a lucid solution of the difficulty.

To tell of the despoiled innocence, and abandoned woe, parental heartbreakings, and the truthfulness of confiding love, blasted forever, by the insidious-demon who has sought his opportunity, under the priestly garh, to visit the happy doniicine of mutual undoubting affection, and by the avowed authority of heaven pressing his suit, and enforcing it by the most awful penal denunciations. Where is the individual, could they see these things as they are, would doubt their bellish origin?
The contumely put upon the laws of God and man; the lying, hypocricy and deceit, practiced, to hide its malignant features from public gaze; furnish the ecessary touches to fill up the diabolic picture.

When we say this crying abomination is forbidden by all the revelations of heaven, in every age, to the children of men; we tell the truth, but not all the truth; there is yet a fearful weight of testimony, remaining untold.- Is there an ominous warning of overthrow, a denunciation of threatened punishment, a signal exhibition of Divine vengeance, recorded in the sacred books? Then they have been directed against these vices.

What concatenation of fiendish influence, could so have darkened the living oracles, as thus far, to have turned the grace of our God into lasciveousness. And oh! what awful mummery, what a stupendous fraud, upon the right use of words, for men who teach the plurality of wives, to prate about virme, righteousness, and godliness. The debaucher; teach virtue! The spoilert and destroyer, virtuous innocence; righteousness!! And the contemner of all law, human and divine; godliness!!!

It is not at all surprising, that men who have adopted such a system, should have lost the light of the spirit of God; any other event, would have given the lie to the great God; who hath declared, "they shall not have the spirit; and they shall deny the faith." How exactly we find this verified in the recent events at Nauvoo, and other places.

OBSERVER.
