# INFIDELITY, NO. 11.

I now Mr. Elitor, according to promise, enter into the subject touching infidelity; what but it is. the causes which produce it, and the arguments generally used to sustain it.

The lofidels, generally neither believe nor disbelieve in the bible, God etc. but for reason which they conceive to be true set them both aside as containing or rather giving an account of things which, whether true or false, are to all, them of no interest whatever, from the fact that it is not in the power of man to become acquainted with them, claiming at the same time as much power to do so as those who believe in them. They say also that as there exists such a variety or multitude of contrarieties amongst those who profess to believe them; one sect claiming that they are right, another that they are, and so on, prove conclusively says the Infidel that the bible is false, or that the people are dishonest inasmuch as they all say that the bible is true; and each have certain principles which they say are true, and sustained by the bible. Tha another equally honest, declares it is contrary to the word of God. For instance the Universalists do not believe that any will be lost but that all men will be saved; and the idea of hell, or fire and brimstone is all non-sense to them, it only signifies a guilty conscience in them who do wrong. The Methodist regards these sentiments with holy horror, and asserts that such doctrines are at open war, and contrary to the bible (which is the standard for both) and will prove the ruin of all those who give heed to them, yea, he cannot even extend the hand of fellowshp to them, because he conceives it blasphemy in the sight of heaven so to do.

In view of these things the infidel asks this question, are they both right inasmuch as toyd ffer? do not each support their claims by evidence from the same book which book is true to the apparent satisfaction of both? and does not one enjoy as much happiness in his belief as the other in his? yes verily, but says he, they cannot both be right because they are opposite in nearly all of their principles and having equal confidence in both of them yet, cannot admit the truth of either, because if either have it, he can easily point out the errors of the other, and show him the way to possess it also, which he will do, provided he is honest. But as this is not done, instead of consolidatng all men in one, establishing harmony and union, which is the effect of truth when observed, shows positively that they do not posеss it

Hence he considers it useless, and time ill spent to trouble himself in relation to the matter; but finds in the world of nature sufficient interest to call forth all the faculties of his mind and body, and by observing and studying her laws, he becomes acquainted with certain principles wich make him happy; and he finds it more important and of greater benefit to himself to devote his time to things that he and can understand, than to trouble himself about a state of existence beyond this life, the truth of which, cannot be established, by evidence such as truth requires, or, at least by neither of the popular sects of the day. Thus the infidel feels justified, in standing aloof from all those who in his opinion, fail in producing evidence in support of their varions systems. In short he knows that he has the same means in his possession, that the christian has to establish its truth, and failing to do so causes him to doubt the statements of those who testify of its truth. Thus if he is honest he will act, and acting he incurs the hatred of the christian through their fears, simply for expressing himself according to his understanding, which is so by reason of greater evidences in its favor, and the more he looks into the book of nature, the stronger the evidence that the world (called) christendom are governed to a great extent at least, by principles totally at war with truth as presented in nature.

He finds that he is governed by certain laws which are eternal in their operations, because they are true; and being true, they are congenial to his nature. He knows that it is true that he exists, by reason of the principles which govern that existence being complied with; which, if not, would prove a negation of all ideas. He knows that two and two inakes four, and that it always will; consequently it never had a beginning as it cannot have an end; and these truths being eternal will always produce the same effect when called into exercise. Again, he knows that his mind and body are hoth necessary in order to enjoy or to be benefited by these truths, or (to use a common phrase.) that they are true by reason of his organization without which, says he, there is no intelligence. Hence the idea of a God without a body, parts or passions, is to him a total negation of all ideas because it embraces nothing that can reffect upon his senses, and possesses no quality, in common with himself, being without form or figure and as a matter of course destitute of motion; for nothing can move unless some

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

## PITTSBURGH, PA.

Postmasters are authorized by law, to frank letters for a third person, containing money, when addressed to an Editor or a publisher of a newspaper.

Will our friends and agents remember this.

It has become so customary for Editors and others, to publish journals of their travels; and as we have just returned from a tour of upwards of two months in the eastern cities, for the satisfaction of our friends, we will give a summary of the events which took place during our journey, which to us were gratifying, as there was nothing which took place but was of the most pleasing character.

Among the churches we visited, there was a great deal of excitement; many of the principle members had either withdrawn from the church or had been cut off, and of this number were the presiding elders of the church of Philadelphia, New York, Boston, New Egypt, N. J. and Woodstown, N. J. On inquiring into the cause of the difficulties, in every instance, it was the spiritual wife system which had caused the separation, and exclusion. The course pursued by the advocates of this system, which were the travelling elders, were, that as soon as a man became dissatisfied with the teachings of these believers in polygamy, and was bold enough to express his dissatisfaction, calling the doctrine incestious, and adulterous, he or she was immediately arraigned before the church, and charged with disobedience to the authorities; and with slandering the heads of the church; an awful appeal was made to the members of the church, at the time of the trial, and every one who dare vote in favor of the person charged. was threatened with immediate exclusion from the church by these tyrants, and thus intimidated, and compelled to obey the mandate of their masters. A notable instance of this was related to me while in Boston, old elder Nickerson, a man who was highly esteemed in Boston, and the father of the church there; when this system, of a plurality of wives, first made its appearance there, rose up against it, as every man of virtue would, and was so deeply effected with it, that he wept over the corruption that was creeping into the church, and declared his intention and determination, to lift his voice against it; this was no sooner known, than he was beseiged by two of the, so called, authorities, and threatened with exclusion, if he dare give testimony against it.

with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."

For farther testimony, I refer you to Acts. 19th chap. 4th verse, "Then said Pau!, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus, when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues, and prophesied."- See also, Heb. 6th chap. 2d verse, where Paul is urging the saints to "go on unto perfection, leaving the principles of the doctrine of baptisms, and laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgements." "You discover in this passage that baptism is mention d in the plural, which signifies, the baptism of water, and of the holy ghost, which was confered by laying on of hands.

Now my readers 1 wish to refer you to the 12th chap. of Cor. by reading which you will understand the effects manifested by the holy ghost anciently. The apostle Paul says that "no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the holy ghost. There are diversities of gifts, of the holy ghost, namely, wisdom. knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, diverse kind of tongues, interpretation of tongues, dreams and visions. But all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will, in the body or church of Christ. In which were set, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, which were given for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. Ephe. 4th chap.

Now my readers having presented before you, the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it was anciently taught by Christ and his apostles which consisted of faith, repentance, baptism for the remission of sins, the gifts of the holy ghost by the laying on of the hands, which gifts were for the work of the ministry and the edifying of the body of Christ, which were to continue until that which is perfect should come. I also wish to say to the whole world of mankind, that as God is an unchangeable -being. I firmly believe that the same gospel and plan of salvation, holy ghost, and graces are equally necessary for the salvation of man, the edifying of the body or church of Christ, and the work of the ministry, in this generation, as they were eighteen hundred years ago.

I with many others, believe it takes the very same gifts, and graces now, to make the church of Christ as it did in those days that there should be no seism in the body or church of Christ.

a proportion of men of literature, talents & intelligence, as this society, indeed, a majority of the society is of this class; men of experience and of sound mind; and what crowns the whole is, that the Lord is with us, revealing his will to us, and what we lack in knowledge is abundantly supplied.

We have conversed with few or none of the saints, but declare they have learned more about the scriptures, and the will of God in relation to his dealings with men, in the last three months, than they had learned in all their life times before.

We have no spiritual wife system to blind our eyes and corrupt our morals-and no system ever invented by men, or devils, could more effectually do it than that for with it comes every evil work, counterfeiting, coining, stealing, perjury, and it is feared not even murder excepted. Men get a number of women around them, and have no way to maintain them but by stealing, coining, counterfeiting, and other such corrupt schemes, they are constantly liable to exposure, and in consequence, recourse must be had to lying, perjury, and every species of duplicity, to conceal; and if infants should be likely to reveal secrets, what must follow? murder, or exposure, and doubtless the former would be chosen.

Having lifted our voices against such abominations; and not only the abominations, but those who practice them, under the sanctimonious garb of religion, we have found the Lord pouring out his spirit, to strengthen us, and enlighten our minds, and comfort our hearts, and making our ways ways of pleasantness, and all our paths paths of peace.

The pressure of business on us at present is so great that we find it very inconvenient to fill the editorial chair of this paper, and, in consequence thereof, the paper for the future will be conducted under the editorial management of Samuel Bennett, M. D.; of whose abilities no man acquainted with him will doubt. We resign the paper into his hands, with the fullest assurance that he is every way capable of rendering it both useful and Interesting, and we do recommend it to the reading public, as a paper every way calculated to gratify the inquiries after biblical truth: and we sincerely expect of all the saints, that no endeavor will be wanting on their parts to give it a widely spread circulation.

We shall write as much for the paper with our own pen, as if we were the editor.

With these remarks we take our leave of the editorial department for the present, with our heart full of gratitude to our heavenly father for the abundant mercy he has bestowed on us, and grateful acknowledgements to the many friends who have sustained us in this most interesting period in our history, until our affairs have assumed a character of stability and much promise.

SIDNEY RIGDON.

It would seem by the Times and Seasons and the New York Prophet, that there is a storm in the camp of the spiritual wife devotees. William Smith has come out over his own signature, in the Prophet, with rather more than innuendoes against one of his brethren of the twelve heads, charging him with a want of that brotherly regard that one apostle ought to have for another, and hopes that the rebuke he gives him, may follow him to the shores of Europe. We suppose that the apostle William thinks that the apostle Wilford, whom he considers no better than himself, should not have made so free with his character while in Philadelphia, a short time before he left for England; and, indeed, we think that the apostle William is more than half right. We cannot see, for our parts, if there should be honor among thieves, why there should not also be honor among spiritual wife men. Now if the apostle William did believe and practice what he believes, and the apostle Wilford believed, and practiced the same things, we cannot see why the apostle Wilford was not bound to defend the character of the apostle William, in Philadelphia, instead of giving a little more than hints in relation to his (William's) want of propriety. We think with the apostle William, that in all this matter he has been abused. We think the apostle Wilford was bound to pluck the beam out of his own eye, before he undertook to get the post out of the apostle William's.

Hampton, Ill. Dec. 23, 1844.

President S. Rigdon:

With feelings of no ordinary character I seat myself to address a few lines to you. Notwithstanding it has been years since I voluntarily withdrew from the "church of Jesus Christ, of Latter Day Saints," yet I have by no means been an un-noticing spectator of the course and doings of that society. With intense anxiety have I watched them. For many noble spirits-virtuous hearts, among them I have, (notwithstanding my many dark, lonesome hours) ever entertained the highest regard. As truly as I believed and valued the truth of divine revelation, so firmly did I believe the work of the Latter day would yet come out and prosper

Cincinnati Ohio,

Elijah R. Swackhammer, to elder Sidney Rigdon president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Dear Brother: my heart's desire and prayer to God for you is, that grace, mercy, and peace, from God our father, and the Lord Jesus Christ may be greatly multiplied unto you, and all that adhere to the truth, for the truth's sake. It is nearly five years since I embraced the doctrine of God, and the Order of Heaven as taught in the Bible, book of Mormon and book of Doctrine and Covenants; and that too not in view of f being turned from it, or of rejecting the first Presidency; or of voting that I do not want a guardian, a prophet or spokesman. For if I build again the things; viz: Sectarianism or a church without a prophet or spokesman, which myself and others have been destroying for years I make myself a transgressor; if there is any truth in Paul's testimony, Gal. 2n 18th, which I have no inclination to do. - And Sir: while I write one single transaction of the people at Nauvoo, who call themselves saints, I tremble for them, and all that follow their example. And if my head were waters. and mine eyes a fountain of tears I would werp for them until all were exhausted if they could be reclaimed. Weep O ye heavens! and gird yourself with sackcloth O ye earth! in con-equence of this soul destroying and heaven daring apostacy which commenced at Nauvon; O ye saints of God that are scattered upon the face of the earth, hear ye, what I am about to write, and tell it to your children, and charge them to tell it to their children, and let the charge go forth from gereration to generation, that it may be a warning to the people of God in all comig time; viz: that on the ever to be remembered, and not to be forgotten, 8 h of August 1844. (see Times and Seasons of September 2d 1844.) at a special meeting of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints convened at the Stand in the city of Nauvoo. President Brigham Young called the audience to order, and arranged the several quorums according to their standing and the rules of the church. At which time he asked them this all absorbing and important question, viz: do you want a guardian, a prophet, a spokesman, or wh tno you want? If you want any of these officers signify it by raising the right hand. Not a hand was raised. President Rigdon, you have been with the church, and counsellor to President Joseph Smith almost from its commencement, and Sir, if you can point out one single transaction that will begin to compare with this, will you please to do it, for I cannot conceive of one. Why, has all our searching in the Bible,

put on the armor. O God, give power to thy servants and give not thy heritage entirely to reproach-0 save a seed-the Branch. W. E. M'L.

in the book of Mormon, and in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and our continued prayers to the Almighty God to know his will and the order of his kingdom, for many years, been in vain, and infinitely worse than in vain? And have these Apostles and their adherants been proclaiming a falshood for more than fourteen years to the people of America, and for many years to the people of England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales Germany, the Islands of the seas, and many other places, where they have been constantly affirming that the true church always has a prophet at its head, and if it has not it is netthe church of God? And have they been testifying falsely, and that too, in the name of the Lord when they have affirmed that his order is the same in every age of the world as to its officers, ordinances, gifts and blessings; and that that der, as to its organization, is the order of heaven itself, and that that order has been given to thein in these last days by no less than the voice of God, the voice of Jesus Christ, by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and by the instruction of Angels, and that that order is to be found in the book of Doctrine and Covenants in such plainness that we might come to an understanding, and inasmuch as we erred it might be made known; and inasuuch as we sought wisdom we might be instructed, that we might repent, and inasmuch as we were humble we might be blessed from on high? No No. But the present apostacy can be accounted for upon other principles than that the revelations are not of God, and that we have not embraced the true order of heaven.

Sir, I look upon the 8th of August A. D. 1844 as one of the most important periods in the history of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; and upon what was done. in Nauvoo on that day as the end, as it were of an old, and the beginning of a new dispensation. And although painful and next to severing the most tender ties koown to iman- kind on earth; yet what the people did at Nauvoo on the above date, and others in other places that have followed their examples jo much more than a sufficient reason for every lover of God ad consequently of the order of his church to withdraw their christian fellow- ship from them.

Yes dear Brother, how unspeakably painful it is to turn from those that we trave so much loved because of the new Covenant, and whom we remembered in our prayers, and those to, from whom we received the gospel land order of the kingdom and priesthood.- And so long as they remained in the office in the which, God had placed them. 1, for one, felt bound by the law of heaven and by the Holy Spirit to sustain them in their respective ffices. But that law does not onjoin it upon me, nor any one, to sustain men in setting at naught the counsel of God. And the Holy Spirit in the which I received the gospel and

St. Louis, Dec. 29th 1844.
DEAR SIR: It is now upwards of four years
since I obeyed the gospel as it was proclaim-
ed by the Latter Day Saints. Since that time
until a few months ago, I have been a regular
-attendant on their meetings both public and
private. But since the death of Joseph in con-
sequence of having some dubiety on my mind
in regard to the twelve's authority to preside
over the church; I have not attended their
meetings so regularly. However a few days
ago, I was requested to attend a council meet-
ing in this place, and thinking that I might
hear something brought forward to prove their
authority, I attended. After some business
had been attended to (viz: cutting a man from
the church because he dared to believe the book
of Doc. and Cov.) the president called upon
me to know if I believed that Joseph Smith
-lived and died a prophet of the Lord, and
whether I believed the twelve, to be the prop
er authorities to preside over that church, and
whether that was the church of Christ or not.
I told him I was one who did not like to re-
ceive any thing without evidence, and as he
had just been informing us that, that was the
place to give instructions and correct errors, I
wished some evidence for the authority of the
twelve. He arose and said that Joseph had
placed that authority upon them just before
his death! I told him that was mere asser-
tion and I wanted some proof before I could
accept it. But you may conceive my aston-
ishment to find that instead of giving the evi-
dence he called a vote of the meeting to cut
me off. When I remonstarted against such

they can sustain themselves by their industry.
