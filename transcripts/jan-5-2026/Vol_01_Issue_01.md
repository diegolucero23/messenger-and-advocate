# TO THE PUBLIC.

In presenting this paper to the reading public, long established usage with editors, has made it a matter of respect to our readers, that we should say a few things in relation to the course we shall pursue, in managing the editorial department.

We have held it as a maxim from early life, that there was a degree of courtesy and condescension, due from one member of society to another, from which men are not at liberty to depart, only when measures of self-defence rendered it an imperious duty a man owed to himself. Men have their religious belief, which to themselves, if to none others, is sacred: they also have their feelings; both of which should be regarded, and treated in a manner becoming the true character of man, It is our intention, in conducting this paper, to exclude from its columns, all matters tending to lessen the character of any person in the estimation of society, or injure their feelings, unless the attempt to maintain our own religious belief should have this effect, or setting forth that of others in its true light.

We have never, at any time, supported a system of religion which rendered necessary an attack on the character of any person to support it, nor never expect to. If our religious belief cannot be maintained on the principles of truth, it is our intention to let it fall.

An appeal to the revelations of heaven, in all disputed points, is an end of all strife with us. To the law and to the testimony, and not men's characters, shall be our standing motto. (Attacks made on our own character by others, we have rarely, very rarely condescended to notice, and this course we will carry out in conducting the editorial department of this paper. We have always let our general course of conduct sustain our character, and if this will not do it, we have but little faith in our being able to do it by our pèn.

We are told by him, whom the world ought to reverence, that all the law, and all the prophets, hang on two principles, love to God, and love to man, and it is our wish that these principles should govern us in the management of this paper;

but, if our patronage will justify it, our readers shall know more of this hereafter.

SIDNEY RIGDON

STEAMBOAT OSPREY
Sept. 25th, 1844.

MR. SAM'L L. FORGEUS.

Dear Brother: I take my pen in hand, this morning, to write you a few lines-informing you of some matters and things as they exist at the present time among the Saints, particularly in Nauvoo.

I think that, if I succeed in my business in St. Louis to-morrow, I shall send my wife and children to Pittsburgh next week; and I expect to follow them within four or five weeks certain, and perhaps sooner. I shall stop two or three weeks in Pittsburgh, and there make myself familiar with the scriptures; and then by the grace of God, go forth among the Saints in the Eastern states, and make known the corruption and awful perversion of the law of the Lord, in the unhallowed and unjustifiable assumption of power by the quorum of the Twelve, in arrogating to themselves the power to lead the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

The following items from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, (2d edition,) clearly show what power and authority they have. Sec. 3, and paragraph 12, reads thus:

"The Twelve are a travelling, presiding High Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeably to the institution of Heaven; to bulld up the Church, and regulate all the affairs of the same, in all-nations: first unto the Gentiles and se ondly unto the Jews."

They are to preside over the affairs of the Church abroad among the nations, not among the Saints in Zion. The 14th paragraph of same section shows that the High Council in Zion are equal, if not superior in authority to the Twelve.

Again, in sec. 104, 6th and 7th paragraphs, we find the following:

"Now I say into you, and what I say unto you I say unto all the twelve, arise and gird up your loins; take up your cross, follow me, and feed my sheep, Exalt not yourselves; rebel not against my servant Joseph, for verlly I say unto

# THE LATTER DAY SAINTS'

you, I am with him, and my hand shall be over
him; and the keys which I have given unto him,
and also to youward, shall not be taken from him
till I come.

Verily I say unto you, my servant Thomas,
thou art the man whom I have chosen to hold
the keys of my kingdom (as pertaining to the
twelve) abroad among all nations, that thou
mayest be my servant to unlock the door of the
kingdom in all places where my servant Joseph,
andimy servant Sidney, and my servant Hyrum,
cannot come; for on them have I laid the burth-
on of all the churches for a little season: where-
fore Whithersoever they shall send you, go ye,
and I will be with you, and in whatsoever place
ye shall proclaim my name, an effectual door
shall be opened unto you, that they may receive
my word; whosoever receiveth my word receiv-
eth me, and whosoever receiveth me, receiv
eth those (the first presidency) whom I have
sent, whom I have made counsellors for my
name's sake unto you."

Still it is said "abroad among all na-
tions;" and in the 12th paragraph the su-
premacy of the First Presidency is set
forth, as well as the subordination of the
Twelve, thus:

"For unto you (the twelve) and those (the
first presidency) who are appointed with you to
be your counsellors and your leaders, is the pow
er of this priesthood given for the last days, and
for the last time, in the which is the dispensation
of the fullness of times, which power you hold in
connection with all those who have received a
dispensation at any time, from the beginning of
creation: for verily I say unto you the keys of the
dispensation which ye have received, have come
down from the Fathers: and last of all, being sent
down from heaven unto you."

The 12th paragraph of Sec. 3d alrea-
dy inserted, expressly says that the
Twelve act under the direction of the
First Presidency. Much more might be
said in support of this position, but the
foregoing must suffice for the present, for
I want to present to you several other
points or subjects of equal importance,
in a brief manner.

On the subject of Joseph Smith having
informed the Twelve that they must bear
off this kingdom to the nations, I an-
swer there was no necessity of his re-
peating this admonition to them, inas-
much as the Lord made this duty obliga-
tory upon them by repeated revelations
through him, but the Lord never said
through Joseph that they should be lead-
ers without a head or First Presidency.
They assert that the burden of the church
was put on them by Joseph. To this I
reply, they shall have it with all good
feelings on my part; but then I say we
have not made it, (the burden,) conse-
quently we will not have it. Now sir,
just read the 3d paragraph of 101st sec.
of Book of Covenants.

"But verily 1 say unto you, I have decreed
that your brethren which have been scattered,
shall return to the land of their inheritances, and
build up the waste places of Zion; so after much
tribulation, as I have said unto you in a former
commandment. cometh the blessing. Behold,
this is the blessing which I have promised after
your tribulations, and the tribulations of your
brethren; your redemption, and the redemption
of your brethren; even their restoration to the
land of Zion, to be established, no more to be
thrown down; nevertheless if they pollute their
inheritances, they shall be thrown down, for I
will not spare them if they pollute their inher-
itances. Behold I say unto you, the redemp-
tion of Zion must come by power; therefore,
I will raise up unto my people a man, who
shall lead them like as Moses led the chil-
dren of Israel, for you are the children of Israel,
and of the seed of Abraham, and ye must need
be led out of bondage by power, and with an
outstretched arm: and as your Fathers were
led at the first, even so shall the redemption
of Zion be. Therefore, let not your hearts faint,
for I say Inot unto you as I said unto your
Fathers, mine angel shall go up before you,
but not my presence; but I say unto you, mine
angels shall go before you, and also my presence,
and and in in time ye shall possess the goodly land."

In this you discover that this society
of Saints are termed the children of Is-
rael, aud the seed of Abraham: and now
compare this with the 23d chap. of Jer.,
and lest you should think it does not ap-
ply to this dispensation and people, read
carefully the 19th and 20th verses, and
mark: "In the latter days ye shall con-
sider it perfectly;" and then, to satisfy
yourself about the burden of the church,
and what it is, read and mark it well
from the 23rd verse to the end of the
chapter, and I trust it will solve the mys-
tery to your entire satisfaction: and then
read the whole of the 34th chap. of Eze-
kiel, and mark every word as you pro-
ceed, as carefully as though your eternal
salvation depended upon it: take partic-
ular notice of the concluding sentence of
the 4th verse, "with force and cruelty
have ye ruled them." And then examine
the 3d and 4th chapters of Isaiah The
first three verses of the 3d chap. tell who
the Lord will take away from Jerusalem.
(I will just say perhaps you will see its
application upon Nauvoo fulfilled.) The
subsequent part of the chapter tells an
awful tale about oppression-the spoil
of the poor-the beating of the people
to pieces the sin of Sodom, which was
more particularly whoredom; also wo-
men rule over them, the princes, and if
you please, the Twelve and others: and
mark what is said about the daughters of
Zion, and their corruptions; and after

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

the Lord positively mentions the horrible
disease which usually follows such abom-
ination, and also the judgment of God
upon them.

In the first verse of the 4th chapter, he
tells a tale about the poor dupes among
women in these days of trouble, who
wish to be called by the name of their se-
ducers to take away their reproach. This
was the ancient law of Israel; when a
man seduced a woman, he had to take
her: but query, was he blessed or cursed?
"And mark in this day of trouble upon
Zion and Israel, the branch of the Lord
(not the whole church,) shall be beautiful
and glorious, when the filth of the daugh-
ters of Zion is washed away," &c.

The fifth chapter tells us about calling
evil good, and good evil; and about those
who justify the wicked for reward; and
the destruction of those leaders and their
subjects, because of transgression; and
the perversion of the law of God-such,
for instance, as the 13th sec. of the Book
of Covenants, 7th paragraph, as follows:

"And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he
that killeth shall die. Thou shalt not steal; and
he that stealeth and will not repent, shall be cast
out. Thou shalt not lie; he that liêth and will
not repent, shall be cast out. Thou shalt love thy
wife with all thy heart, and shall cleave unto her
and none else; and he that looketh upon a woman
to lust after her, shall deny the faith, and shall not
lhave the spirit, and if he repents not he shall be
cast out. Thou shalt not commit adultery: and
he that committeth adultery, and repenteth not,
shall be cast out; but he that has committed adul-
tery, and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh
it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive; but if
he doeth it again, he shall not be forgiven, but
shall be cast out. Thou shalt not speak evil of thy
neighbor, nor do him any harm. Thou knowest
my laws concerning these things are given in my
scriptures: he that sinneth and repenteth not, shall
be cast out."

From the above we see that if they
transgress the law of the land, they shall
be delivered up to the proper authorities.
Again, it is said in that book, "if ye keep
my commandments ye have no need to
transgress the laws of the land:" and fur-
thermore, "he that will be my disciple must
observe all the commandmends and cove-
nants of the church." Now, query, are
these commandments kept by (the Israel
of the latter days,) the church in Nauvoo?
Are the people in Nauvoo what they pro-
fess to be, a law abiding people? Do
they submit to be tried by the laws of the
the land, and by the proper authorities?
Now it is expressly said that "whosoever
refuseth to submit to the laws of the land,
even to the laying down of his life, is not
my disciple."

I will now call your attention to the
11th chapter of Isaiah; in the first verse
we have an account of a father and son,
not much, however, is said about the fath-
er, but a great deal about the son. In the
19th verse is described a greater man than
either: "he shall stand as an ensign for
the people, and the gentiles shall seek his
rest.

The 3d paragraph of 101 Sec. Book of
Cov. which I have already inserted, says,
"the Lord will raise up a man who shall
be great like unto Moses, and like him
shall he lead this people out of bondage."
This could not be Joseph Smith, for he
was raised up seven years before this
revelation was given; here then are two
testimonies, and the one actually given by
Joseph Smith. Now the only question
that can arise, is, who remained on earth
at the death of Joseph and Hiram, with
the ordination of Prophet, Seer, and Rev-
elator? I answer peremptorily, Sidney
Rigdon was the only man that was then
in the church on earth, who was ordain-
ed to this office, and that too by revela.
tion. You will find an account of this
ordination in the Times and Seasons,
bearing date, June 1st 1841. Prior to this
he was ordained by revelation to be one of
the 1st presidency of the church, and as
you will see from the following, made
equal with Joseph in holding the keys of
the kingdom, and also the keys of the
school of the prophets, which was to be
organized and instituted for the salvation
of the Gentiles, Jews, and as many as will
come. Book Cov., Sec. 85, 3d and 5th
paragraphs.

"And again, verily I say unto thy brethren
Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams, their
sins are forgiven them also, and they are account-
ed as equal with thee in-holding the keys of this
last kingdom: as also through your administration
the keys of the school of the Prophets, which I
have commanded to be organized, that thereby they
may be perfected in their ministry for the salvation
of Zion, and of the nations of Israel, and of the
Gentiles, as many as will believe, that through your
administration they may receive the word, and
through their administration the word may go
forth unto the ends of the earth, unto the Gentiles
first, and then behold, and lo, they shall turn unto
the Jews; and then cometh the day when the arm
of the Lord shall be revealed in power in convinc-
ing the nations, the heathen nations, the house of
Joseph, of the gospel of their salvation.
And now verily I say unto you, I give unto you

than most men in this age; at all events Joseph said that he had. And as for Joseph saying he would have him no longer for counsellor, it was not his prerogative to shake him off; he did not call and consequently could not reject him, but at any rate we all know when he was tried before the conference last October, every thing was there disposed of, and Elder Rigdon was sustained by the people and honorably acquitted of all charges against him; and Hiram then and there prophesied, that he should conquer and triumph over all his enemies, and that he should be a mighty man on the earth.

Now truly here is a prophecy worthy of notice, and on this point I will only add, that two years-will tell a tale that will astonish the world. And as to his having at any time conspired against the church and Joseph, is a baseless fabric built by the: Twelve, and like that of all others who run before they were sent; therefore are not worthy of any reply. You may now ask what our views are relative to -Joseph? to which I reply, just what the Lord has said about him, that he should * hold the keys-which he had received, - which were the keys of Elijah or in other words the keys of the doctrine, but we do not believe that he has ever received the keys of David, spoken of by John in the 3d chap. of Rev. which opens and no man closes, &c. But, enquires the objector, you believe Joseph transgressed? I answer, he himself confessed he was but a man and liable to sin like other men. But, says one, do you believe that he was cut off for transgression? I reply, he had the promise, if he remained faithful he should translate the other plates of the Book of Mormon, which are now sealed; also that he said and did many things in direct opposition to the word of God, as given through himself; but we do not judge him, we leave him in the hands of a just and merciful God. And now one word with respect to the plurality wife doctrine. It is contrary to the laws of the land, and is therefore wrong; for we are told in the Book of Covenants, that if we keep the commandments of the Lord we need not transgress the laws of the land. Again, it is positively forbidden in the 7th section of the above book. In reference to this mattter, we shall in the future, answer in great plainness and with decision.

We profess to believe that the Lord has again the second time (which makes the third time,) set his hand to redeem his covenant people, which are left, &c., according to Isaiah 11th chap., and 11th verse. Mark the Words again the second time," first by Moses, secondly by Josepli, Sarith, and again the 2d time by Elder Rigdon, and others who now stand up for the truth, and the principles of virtue.

You will doubtless remember that Isaiah says that the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner. We know that this passage is generally made to apply to the Jews, rejecting Christ, but look at it for one moment, and see for yurself: that the Jews rejected Christ, is true; but you know they were not the builders, of his kingdom or church, but the apostles were the builders, and they did not reject him 1800 years ago, but the builders in this church, the Twelve and other big men and builders have rejected Sidney Rigdon, and used, and continue to use their influence with the people against him; and wo be to them for it. The people may reject and forsake their leader, for they were influenced by such arguments as were calculated to deceive, if possible, the very elect; but, thank God, the eyes of the people are opening daily to see the truth, and will continue so to do. The Twelve told the people that Joseph had given them their authority in the secret chambers, but Christ says go not after them into the secret chambers, nor into the desert," or wilderness, like Lyman Wyght, who has gone with Sabout 300 souls from Nauyoo; and companies are daily leaving. We know these are all delusions, and from the devil; and had not the Lord called a few to begin with, and re-organized the church, the priesthood would have been taken, and we would have had nothing left but an apostate church, as described by Paul in 1st Tim., 4th chap., 1st and 2d verses, where you find these remarkable words: "Now the spirit speaketh expeessly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith-giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron." An awful state of wickedness indeed: a conscience so void of truth as to lie in the

ble before all men, and may the fear of
the excited multitude prevent them from
doing any harm to thy people; and may
this fear iuduce them to be instrumental
in assisting thy saints to dispose of their
effects, that they shall make their escape
from the city that thou wilt scourge. And
in thy wisdom grant all the blessings un-
to thy people that they need, and thy
name, together with the Son and Holy
Ghost, shall have all the praise and
glory forever, AMEN.

And now my dear brother, I will refer
you to another chapter, viz: the 3rd of
Paul's 2d epistle to Timothy, and I will
here preface my remarks upon this chap-
ter, by saying, that I have not applied a
single verse which is not applicable, al-
though it may be said that the Mormons
have used this very passage against the
Catholic church and her offspring. I
answer yes, and truly too; but remem-
ber, there are very many scriptures
which have been fulfilled in part, in
former and present times, and in part
will be fulfilled in future... I will give
you one instance as evidence of this fact.
Peter quoted the 2d chapter of Joel as
being applicable, and part fulfilled on the
day of Pentecost when the people spake
in tongues and prophesied, &c. Now.
every person that reads this, knows that
Peter made a fair application, although
it was fulfilled in part only; so you see
there is a double applicatien to be made
of many prophesies; and certainly you
will see the force of my reasoning at once,
for if there was certain workers of iniqui-
ty among Israel in the days of Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, or in the days of
Peter, Paul, Jude, and others, or among
the Nephites, Lamanites, Jaredites, or
any other Ites; and God spake and named
his judgments as punishments upon them.

Every person will be forced to con-
fess, that the same cause will produce
the same effects in the 19th century.
among Israel, or latter-day saints and
sinners, or else God is a changeable be-
ing, and if so, he is neither righteous,
just nor merciful; for it is a self evident
fact that if men deserved punishment
for doing certain things in the morning
of the creation, in the meridian of time
or in the latter days, that God will in

flict the same punishments under the
same circumstances, whether in Jeru-
salem, Zion, or among sinners making
no profession. The only variation God-
will make, is the variation of circum-
stances by which men and women are
surrounded, when they depart from the
rule of rectitude and righteousness, the
same rule will apply and hold good in
regard to omission of well known and
defined duties towards God and man.

Now I shall proceed to call your at-
tention to the inhabitants of Nauvoo
generally, and ask you to point the
crime-named in the 3d of 2d Tim.
which has not been committed, but
mark especially the 5th, and then more
particularly the 6th verse, and the 7th;
and in the 8th, and in the 9th and 10th,
you will find the final result of this sum
of all villanies, namely, that they shall
proceed no farther, but shall be exposed
to all men. And now I will bring my
subject to a close by referring to the
case of David, as given in the 12th
Chapter of the second Book of Sam-
uel, where it is said, "the Lord re-
buked David for wickedness, in having
Uriah killed," but told him he had giv-
en him all his master's wives &c. &c.,
and would have given him more if he
had not enough, but this is not true,
the language of the Lord, as represent-
ed, is, "I would have given thee such
and such things," but here I will ob--
serve that I do not wish to cavil or dis-
pute the translation, only I shall claim
the privilege of saying that, as the book
of Mormon was translated by the gift
and power of God, it is more precious
and more to be esteemed by the saints
than ten thousand garbled translations
of uninspired linguists of King James'
day, or any other day, and now re-
member, that the 2d chapter of the
book of Jacob says emphatically, that
David and Solomon truly had many
wives, but this thing was abominable
before my face, wherefore this people
shall not seek to excuse themselves for
committing whoredoms; but if they do,

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

and now, if you make this covenant be-
fore God, you will not be a long time
without knowledge for yourself on this
subject; and you can then testify to the
truth of those things that I have spoken
of, and which I can testify to before an
assembled world.

I have realized what Paul said about the
love of God 'shed abroad in the heart, and
also, that principalities, nor powers, in
earth or hell, cannot move me from those
things, which I have written, and God,
who tries the reins, and searches the heart
of man, as with a lighted candle, knows
that I would rather lay down my life, than
deny Elder Rigdon's mission; or assent
to being governed or led by the spirit, it
self, that President Young (who is pre
sumed to speak the mind of the Twelve,)
is governed by. Thank God I know their
spirit, and want none of it; no, not to save
myself from the jaws of deatli. And now,
a few ideas on the subject of spirits, and
a liability of being deceived. The four
teenth Chap. of Ezekiel tells the story
how men may be deceived. If a man goes
to God and asks him to grant any thing
that he has expressly forbidden. The
Covenants have given us a key to try spir-
its, which will continue to be an unerring
one, for the present and future; if you see
a spirit, ask God to give it to you, and if
you cannot get it, know assuredly that it
is not of God; and again, if the spirit con-
tradicts the plain and precious things that
are written in the book of Covenants, and
book of Mormon; again, whatsoever spirit
admonisheth to do good, and keep the
written word and commandments of God,
is of God, for light cleaveth unto light.
Ah, but says one, that is no criterion to
judge by, well, I answer, God says it, and
man says no. Who shall I believe? I
answer, God; though it makes a liar of
every man in the world, even Prophets,
Priests, and Kings, and also apostles.
Well, says the objector, why cannot I get
it? because you are unwilling to have it
Now mark, if a man asks for a spirit, and
cannot get it, but gets a spirit of anger,
and full of fight, and it arouses all the evil
passions and propensities in man, you
may know that he has got an evil spirit;
for instance, I hear Bigham Young, and
am in doubt about the spirit, and I ask
-God to give me the spirit, but I don't get
it, well I know then it is not of God, or
suppose fask God, and get a fighting and
contentious spirit, you may know I have a
devil, and that is very likely to be correct;
for the devil hates principles of truth.
Now, no man need tell me that he has
got the spirit, of Christ, provided he cannot
reason upon the word of God without get-
ting mad; for the Lord has commanded us
to pray for them that use us despitefully,
and bless them that curse us, return good
for evil and in this way gain our enemy.
Well, says one, the covenants teach, that
if our enemies, smite us the thir For fourth
time we may fight them; yes, it does, but
it is speaking of the church collectively,
and not individually, and even then, it is
said if we continue to suffer wrong, we
shall be blest; but whenga man begins to
mock, scoff, and deride, you cannot say it
is of God; for the angel of God dare not
bring a railing accusation against Satan,
but said "the Lord rebuke thee." Here I
have given some few testing points, but
read the book, and pray that you may have
the same spirit that indicted "It, and all will
be peace and joy in the Holy Ghost; and
then there will be neither doubt nor fear.
As for their keys they talk about, I know
they don't tell the truth, they want to be
wise above the plain simple word of the
Lord, and therefore become fools.

Now, touching the definition of the word
keys, what is it? power to unlock, to un-
derstand; and for the enduement they (the
Twelve,) talk about, it is knowledge, and
thank God, I am not indebted to them, för
it, for they have not got it to give; I will
not say that I have it, or that I have not,
but I say that they have not got it, for God
has rejected them and their works; and I
know it. The day they rejected Elder
Rigdon, they sealed their fate; but they
are the Lord's anointed, and God reserves.
the right to judge and punish them, and he
will not use any of his saints for that pur-
pose, but those that are his enemies who
are ripening for destruction; and the man
who lays his hand upon them, for violence
will be damned, be he saint or sinner, or
that moves with malice in his heart against
them, and brings evil upon them. Why
then, says one, do you say anything that
will exasperate the mob?
I answer, I am not acting with or from
malicious or sinister motives, but with an
eye single to the glory of God and the sal-
vation of the people; and am not responsi-
ble for the doings of any mobocratic move
ments. I answer again, I know my mis-
sion, and consequently, it is immaterial to
me how men may judge of my motiver

with this exception, that they had better
judge righteous judgements, for with what-
ever judgement they judge others, will they
be judged, hence the matter is self evi-
dent that righteous judgement will be more
to their advantage; I know this is a matter
of much more importance than the people
may generally think: but while I declare
that the Twelve are apostates from the
church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints,
and that I believe some of them are guilty
of the most awful perversion of the word
of God; I do not think that it is any per
son's business, except those who belong
to the Church, or those who desire to do
so. It is my right, it is theirs, and every
one else's right to believe what they please,
and if they are satisfied with their system,
and get people to believe it, they may do
so, and I will not mock or deride them,
but pity and pray for them and the people;
and I shall on future occasions, as on the
past, take the opportunity of warning all
men to beware of fiarming them, or their
adherents, and if they should be assailed
from any source on account of crimes, or
transgressions of the laws of the land, I
can only say, that I shall convict none of
them, by swearing them guilty; I wish,
however, not to be understood that I know
nothing at all; but matters that were en-
trusted to me confidentially, there are not
men, nor courts, nor lawyers enough to
bring them out of me... It is true, that inen
have voluntarily entrusted me with their
business and secrets; yet they were neces-
citated so to do, and I should count myself
the most abandoned wretch to take any ad-
vantage of them because of such knowl-
edge, and should they take the liberty of
slandering me, my course will be to tell
what I believe, on other people's testimony
and not what I know confidentially, this
would not convict any one in courts of jus-
tice, as hearsay is no evidence against any
person. And notwithstanding men may
be guilty of crime committed against me,
for which I might deem it my privilege to
prosecute at the law, according to the book
of Covenants; but here allow me to say,
that if any man has been guilty of crime,
let him be careful for the future, and keep
his abominations from my view or knowl-
edge, as my feelings for the cause of vir-
tue and decency, law and order, will com-
pel me to defend the innocent, and pro-
tect those who may not have sufficient
courage to do so for themselves; but I will
eay that without the interposition of any of
those who receive S. Rigdon as their lead-
er, suits will be instituted and fearful con
sequences may result from such prosecu-
tions, the hand of God is upon them, to ar-
rest them in their wild career, and this you
may mark, and upon the people of the city
of Nauvoo and county of Hancock. This
I believe from the fact that God has said
it. Now if you inquire, when will these
things come to pass? I answer, they are
now taking place in some measure; and if
I shall be so fortunate as to see you, I will
tell you things that I would not write, as
they might come into their enemies mouths
and do them much injury; and perhaps
lead to serious consequences, and I have
said that I do not intend to do or bring evil
upon them. Nevertheless, it will come,
but by the enemies of God and man, and
not by the instrumentality of those who are
saints and keep the commandments of
God.

Now, with reference to the church, gen-
erally, I believe them to be honest, indus-
trious and good citizens, but nevertheless,
I know they have been duped in regard to
following the counsel of men, instead of
following the commandments of God, as
given through Joseph Smith-I have been
among the number of those who felt wil
ling to follow counsel to almost any
extent, this is wrong, and the people are
now told they must follow the counsel of
the Twelve, and if they do, I tell you there
is not virtue enough left in Nauvoo to save
them from destruction, temporally and
spiritually; temporal, because the excited
multitude will not stand it. I have seen
the consequences that will result from this
course of things, and therefore take the
liberty of telling them in private. I have
spoken on the stand once, about three
quarters of an hour, and next Sunday. I
have an appointment on Main street in
front of my house. I expect to do and
say nothing about men, but measures I in-
tend to criticise upon. I shall make use of
the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Cov-
enants; and from them I expect to prove
to the people, that serious trouble is at the
door. I am compelled to take this course
and thus set the minds of the people at
work, and warn them to repent and for-
sake their evil ways and doings, and
humble themselves before God, and learn
his will and then do it, and thus save them-
selves and others.

land, except in this one thing, of which I have cause to regret, and that is, I would help to put down men and women's char- acters to sustain those heads of the church who were engaged in the corruptions we complain of. I could and would slan- der the character of this unfortunate class, who happened to be victims of the unhal- lowed passions of those men. I have been making every acknowledgment and repa- ration in my power, and I cannot do more; but the same measure I have measured un- to others, I expect will be measured to-me by those who are equally zealous, and who have no more knowledge concerning the doings of God: here is a frank confes sion, and if any one is disposed to take the advantage of it he may do so; but let him look well to what he is doing.

And now I shall close by calling your particular attention to the 101st Sec. of Book of Cov. 2d paragraph, where the Lord decrees the saints shall never be over- come, if they observe all his counsel, (not Joseph's;) but if not, they should be over come or prevailed against by their enemies, because they were set to be a light unto the world; and if they would not be a light they were thenceforth good for nothing; but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men. And in the 3d par. it is said, if they pollute their inheritances, they shall be thrown down. Query, have they not been driven several times since 1835, at which time the persecution commenced in the State of Missouri and finally expelled from the State, and have they not been every year since severely scourged in this State? Yes verily. Do they keep the commandments? No, or else they would have prevailed against their enemies: think well on this revelation. In the 68th Sec. 1st paragraph we are expressly told they were driven for transgression; and now look well to the parable in the 6, 7, and Sth paragraphs and see the 12 olive trees, (apostles,) nobleman, (Lord,) choice land, (Nauvoo,) tower, (Temple,) the servants began to build, but did not finish; the olive trees destroyed; the servants fled and their works broken down; then the Lord-said to one of his servants, (nottwelve,) go and gather together, &c. &c.; and the servant went and done as he was commanded, and after many days all things were fulfilled. Meditate well on this parable.

Yours respectfully,

JOHN A. FORGEUS.

Minutes of a Conference held in Pittsburgh,

The conference was opened in the usual manner, and on motion, Elder R. Savery was appointed President, and Elder J. Logan, Secretary.

Elder B. Winchester. then stated the object of the meeting which was, to dis- tinctly ascertain the minds of the members of the church in this place, relative to the heretical doctrines taught and practiced in Nauvoo, by the quorum of the Twelve and some of their associates, and also the claims of Elder S. Rigdon. On these points Elders Winchester, Savery, and several others, made some very appro- priate and forcible remarks; after which, the following preamble and resolutions were adopted without a dissenting voice:-

Whereas the quorum of the Twelve, and their adherents in Nauvoo, have reject- ed Elder S. Rigdon as the presiding offi- cer of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and thus violating the law of the church, as found in the the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, which we esteem most sacred and dear to all lovers of truth, for no other reasons, in our opinion, than his having claimed his lawful standing in- the church, and his decided opposition to the nefarious doctrine of polygamy, and other things odious in their nature and ten- dendency; for the truth of which, it now becomes our painful duty to say to all our friends and bretheren in Christ, we have the most positive and decisive evidence; wherefore, -

1. Resolved, that we feel it our impera- tive duty, to receive and sustain Elder S. Rigdon in the office of first president of the church, whereunto, according to the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord has called him; and also that we uphold him in this office by our faith and prayers..

2. Resolved, that in consequence of the most flagrant violation of the original, or true principles and order of the church, by the Twelve and their abettors, by reject- ing Elder Rigdon, and practising the doc- trine of polygamy, despoiling female vir- tue and chastity by seducing them, and tyranizing over those who will not sanc tion their works of darkness, and many other like things, for which we regard them as apostates, and men fallen from the true order of the church, into a state of wickedness and corruption; therefore, we hold no fellowship with them, and as a

branch of the true church, standing upon whom we shall adhere until we are offici-
the original platform, and the acknowl- ally informed of his death or expulsion, in
edged and received doctrine of said church, a legal manner, from this Church.
we do not consider ourselves identified
with them.

3. Resolved, that we sincerely request
and advise all of our friends and bretheren
that stand connected with us in the true
cause of God, to join with us in our effort
and that we may redeem our characters
from the odium and disgrace that the
Twelve and others have brought upon us
all, or in other words, all the church, by
their evil practices, as mentioned in pream
ble and previous resolution.

4. Resolved, that we hereby avow to all
men both far and near, that we have the
most implicit confidence in the Bible, Book
of Mormon, and Book of Doctrine and
Covenants, and that we receive them as
our rule of faith and practice.

5. Resolved, that Elders Wingate, Wm
Richards, J. B. Newton, and B. Winches
ter, have authority from this conference to
go as messengers to the eastern branches
of the church, and set before them the true
state of the church, and regulate the affairs
of the same.

6. Resolved, that a copy of these
minutes be handed to the editor of the
"Messenger and Advocate," for publica-
tion.

On motion, conference adjourned sine
die.

All things passed off quietly in the
conference. The saints were cheerful
and seemed to be in good spirits, and a
general spirit of union pervaded the whole
congregation.

PRESIDENT S. RIGDON-Dear Sir:-
hasten to lay before you the position of
affairs in this place. On Sunday a meeting
of the branch was called at which most of
the members were present. After laying
the matter of the Presidency before the
Branch, it was

Resolved, 1st That we recognize no
other order than that of the First Presiden-
cy as head of the Church, and the other
quorums in their place as set forth in the
Book of Doctrines and Covenants.

Resolved, 2d, That we recognize Elder
Sidney Rigdon as the only President of the
Church of Jesus Christ, known to us, to
Resolved, 3d, That we publish to the
world the following, over the signatures of
the male meinbers of this branch, who ad-
here to the ancient order of the Church:

*To the Saints of Beaver County the Un*
*dersigned send, greeting.*

Having learned that certain persons (call-
ing themselves saints,) do teach the doc.
trine of the Necolaitans, or in other words,
"Spiritual Wives," professedly by divine
authority, thus "turning the grace of our
Lord'into laciviousness." This, therefore,
is to say to such persons and to all men,
that we neither believe or receive a doc-.
trine so repugnant to the Word of God,
and we hold no fellowship with those who
would justify such an abomination; and
we earnestly exhort the saints in every
place to set their faces against so pernici-
ous a doctrine. And besides this giving
all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
to virme knowledge.

"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be

BR. J. GREIG-Dear Sir:-Yours of
the 14th inst., was received per mail this
morning. The intelligence was cheer-
ing; these early evidences of the virtue
and firm integrity of the saints speaks
volumes in favor of their future pros-
pects... What, dear brother, can with-
stand the truth when its advocates are
uncompromising in their attachment to
virtue and holy principles. Since the
world began, all the dispensations deliv-
ered to men of the living God, have been
thrown into confusion by the introduction
of doctrines and practices which were at
war with godliness, and subversive of
all that was good and noble. Hence the
distraction of the religious world. At
some times past so great were the de-
partures from truth, by those who pro-
fessed to be the people of God, that if a
Noah, a Daniel, and a Job had been among
them, they could save their own souls

only, and not be able even to save à son applied to the professing world, are as ap-
or daughter. Such an attempt has Satan
made on us, and was maturing his plan
so completely to effect our overthrow, that
the few left who could not be corrupted
could do nothing more than-save their
own souls; but the iniquity was discov-
ered before the adversary had gotten the
fangs of his corruption so fastened on us
that we could not unfasten them.

I have been informed, since Mr. Page
published his Bull, and subsequent de-
parture from this place, that he had at-
tempted to teach the doctrine of spiritu-
al wives in this city some time since.
This will account for his sudden-depar-
ture from both this place and yours.

It would seem almost impossible that
there could be found a set of men and
women, in this age of the world, with
the revelations of God in their hands,
who could invent and propagate doctrines
so ruinous to society, so debasing and
demoralizing as the doctrine of a man
having a plurality of wives; for it is the
existence of this strange doctrine-worse
than the strange fire offered on the altar,
by corrupted Israel-that was at the root
of all the evils which have followed, and
are following in the church, the very
mention, of which could not fail to redden
the cheeks of decency with a blush.

The whole of the revelations of God
in all ages, charge the prophets and lead
ers of the people, with being the authors
of the corruptions, which from time to
time overrun the people of God. We
need not marvel then that like evils have
befallen us. The crime of the people
was that they loved to have it so, they
were not charged with introducing the
corruptions, but having pleasure in them
after the prophets, and leaders, had intro-
duced them. It is no small degree of
satisfaction to me, to find the people ri-
sing in the exercise of their just rights,
and casting off, not only the leaders, but
those who are led by those corrupters,
seducing spirits which introduce doc-
trines of demons.

Those who read the New Testament
with care, cannot avoid seeing that the
apostles have declared that a corruption
like that we complain of, was to make its
appearance in the last days. See Second
Timothy, 3d chapter, from the 1st to the
9th verse inclusive. These sayings
which the apostles, at Nauvoo, have ap-
plicable to themselves as to any others
now living, or any others who have lived
since the days of Paul. In the 6th verse
we are told that "For of this sort are they
which creep into houses, and lead captive
silly women laden with sins, led away
with divers, lusts." Now of what sort
are those who creep into houses and lead
astray silly women? The answer is giv-
en in the preceeding verse. Persons that
can do that are such as are without na-
tural affection, boasters, proud inventors
of evil things, heady, high-minded, lovers
of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
When we see such men, as above descri-
bed, they, according to Paul, would do
other things, that is, enter into houses
and lead astray silly women.

That the Twelve and their adhérents
have entered into houses and led silly
women astray, is a fact susceptible of the
highest proof; and we are authorized by
Paul to apply all the rest he has said to
them. "For if this sort enter into houses
and lead astray silly women," what sort?
we ask the before described religionists,
for says Paul, "they have a form of god-
liness." The conclusion then is, that
they effected the ruin of silly females,
by, or through a form of godliness,

Paul says, the corruption he has des-
cribed was to take place in the last days.
Now, from this, the people of the last
days are authorized to call any thing of
the kind which may make its appearance
it matters not by whom these corruptions
were introduced, Prophet, Apostle, Evan-
gelist, or Pastor, whosoever introduces
them, has an account to settle with Paul
in the great day when the affaias of the
universe shall be adjusted before an um-
pire who cannot err, for either these doc-
trines and practices are corruptions, or
else Paul stands charged with a depar-
ture from truth.

From what is said in the 9th verse, the
iniquity complained of was to be a thing
conducted in secret. "But they shall pro-
ceed no further, for their folly shall be
manifest unto all men;" Nothing can
be plainer than that this abomination of
leading silly women astray, was to be a
secret thing-carried on privately, and
the exposure of it was to put a final stop
to their wickedness. "But they shall
proceed no further, for their folly shall
be made manifest."

# THE LATTER DAY SAINTS

This secret working in matters of re-
ligion is, and always has been evidence
of corruption. The saints always have
been warned against the secret works of
darkness; light and truth not only mani-
fest themselves, but also make manifest
the secret works of darkness, It is equal-
ly plain according to Paul, that no such
thing could be carried on, however secret-
ly it might be done, without detection.
"For their folly SHALL be made manifest."
Those leaders of silly women, if they
had regarded the scriptures, might have
known that their race was a short one,
and that their wickedness would be made
manifest; for thus had Paul written more
than 1700 years ago, and as proof that
Paul was inspired behold it has come to
pass in our day and before our eyes.

It is a fact so well known, that the.
Twelve and their adherents have endeav-
ored to carry on this spiritual wife bus-
iness in secret, that I hardly need men-
tion it here, and have gone to the most
shameful and desperate lengths, to keep
it from the public. First, insulting inno-
cent females, and when they resented the
insult, these monsters in human shape
would assail their characters by lying,
and perjuries, with a multitude of despe-
rate men to help them to effect the ruin of
those whom they had insulted, and all
this to enable them to keep these corrupt
practices from the view of the world.
I could bring facts which can be estab-
lished in any court of justice, in relation
to these vile abominations practised un-
der the garb of religion that would make
humanity blush. No falsehood too great,
and no perjury too daring, in order to
conceal these heaven-daring abuses of
mankind; but I say in the language of
Paul, they shall go no further, for their
folly is now being made manifest, and
will not cease until it is manifest unto all.

How often have these men and their
accomplices stood up before the congrega-
tion, and called God and all the holy An-
gels to witness, that there was no such
doctrine taught in the church; and it has
now come to light, by testimony which
cannot be gainsaid, that at the time they
thus dared heaven and insulted the world,
they were living in the practice of these
enormities; and there were multitudes of
their followers in the congregation at the
time who knew it. These things only
tend to confirm the fact that the church of

Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the
true church of God, for we now see in
that body fulfilling, what the Apostles and
Prophets said should take place in that
order of things which God acknowledged.
According to both prophets and apostles,
the true church in the last days would be
tried, with all the corruptions which had
overthrown all the previous orders, king-.
doms, or churches which God had set
up; and before she could be exalted to her
true glory, to overcome all the inventions
of Satan or of man: but more of this in
our next.

Dear Brother, through this letter to
you, I would call on all the saints into
whose hands this may come, to arise and
deliver themselves from the corruption,
disorder and ruin, that satan through the
Twelve as instruments, designs to bring
upon them, know ye that no strange
thing has befallen you, that an attempt is
being made upon you by those in high
authority, and those who are arrogating
to themselves authority in violation of
the order of heaven.

SIDNEY RIGDON.

[TO BE CONTINUED]

To all the Members of the Church of
Jesus-Christ of Latter Day Saints.

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 15, 1844,

I embrace the present opportunity of say-
ing to you all, that after a very eareful in-
vestigation of the claims of Elder S. Rig-
don to the office of the First Presidency of
the Church, I am satisfied they are not
only just but lawful, and as far as this mat-
ter is concerned I have made up my mind,
not from either any personal preference or
animosity, but from the law or rules of the
Church, as found in the book of Doctrine
and Covenants and Book of Mormon

It is abundantly evident to my mind that
the quorum of the Twelve and others have
excited a certain portion of the Church to
reject Elder Rigdon, (which is a most hor-
rid outrageupon the laws of the same,) from
a fear he would bring them to an account, or
in other words, to justice for teaching and
practising the doctrine of polygamy. They
of course reasoned from the well known fact,
that he has always heen a determined op--
ponent to any thing of the kind.
And allow me here to inform you, that
it is my intention at present, to publish as

soon as possible, a work in which I shall of the character of this attempt, and of the char-
cancel the claims of Elder Rigdon at length, acter of those who could condescend to it. I
and expose the advocates of the "Spiritual here leave them to enjoy all the pleasure their
Wife System" by referring you to facts situation can give they are welcome to it.
and evidence of the most undoubted author-
ity. Yours respectfully,
B. WINCHESTER.

To the Editor of the "Messenger aud Advocate."
DEAR SIR:-Will you please insert the
above in your paper, and accept of an as-
surance that you have my best wishes for
the prosperity of your (by me contempla-
ted,) valuable paper, and oblige
Yours, B. W.

MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

PITTSBURGH, OCT. 15, 1844.

The "Times and Seasons," and the "Nauvoo
Neighbour," published at Nauvoo, Illinois, are
busying themselves about us exceedingly, though
the editor says he reluctantly obtrudes our name
before the public. Now if he would be as re-
luctant to publish falsehoods about us when he
does obtrude our name upon the public, it would
be as creditable to him. The old saying that
"drowning men catch at straws" is fulfilled to the
letter in the editors weak attempt to injure us.
He has strained hard to squeeze out something
by which he could make an unfavorable impres-
sion on the public mind. We wrote a letter
which was published in the People's Organ, at
St. Louis, Mo,, stating facts and nothing else but
facts, in relation to what took place on our visit
at Nauvoo a few weeks since; and the editor and
Mr. Hyde, who have both written on the subject,
knew this as well as we, and they know it now;
but by giving publicity to an ignorant farce which
came off in Nauvoo, they thought to impeachrour
character, but in this weak and ignorant attempt
they will fail.

What is the matter of complaint! It is this:
We said that the only crime we committed was,
that there were a number of gentlemen who wish.
ed to return with us to Pittsburgh. This they say
was false, and to prove it, publish-an-investigation,
said to have been had in Nauvoo, when we were
charged with trying to divide the church. Now,
how were we dividing the church? The only
ground of this charge was that a number of per-
sons were desirous of returning with us to Pitts-
burgh, and these defamers knew it. It is this
they call dividing the church, and then say
they opposed us for dividing the church, and
not because that there were those who desired
to go with us to Pittsburgh. Now, reader, judge

But there was another and greater cause for
their opposition to us than the crime of having
those at Nauvoo whose personal friendsitip made
them desire to be where they could enjoy our
society. Gentle reader, do you desire to know
what it was? Well, it is your right, as well as
the right of saint and sinner to know it. Know
then, that the so called 'Tiwelve apostles at Nau-
voo, are now teaching the doctrine of, what is
called Spiritual Wives: that a man may have
morewives-than-one. and they are not only teach-
ing it but practising it, and this doctrine is spread.
ing alarmingly through that apostate branch of
the church of Latter Day Saints. Their greatest
objection to us was our opposition to this doc-
trine, knowing, as they did, that we had goi the
fact in possession, it created alarm, great-alarm,
every effort was used while we were there to ef-
fect something that might screen them from the
consequences of exposure. This is what Mr.
Hyde had an allusion to on the steam boat at St.
Louis, when he felt such an interest in our welfare,
as he said, as to request us. not for his sake or his
fellow apostles sakė, but for our own sake and
salvation, to make any disclosures, lest we should
have to retract and thereby be injured.. Kind
man! how fatherly and apostolical this!

I now call upon the twelve, including Mr. J.
E. Page, to deny the existence of such a doctrine
among them, believed taught and practised by
them. This is the doctrine which has made what
these men call the division in the church. We
deny it has made any division in the Church.
The Church is taking Paul's advice, "From such
turn away;" the Church is doing so. See the
third chapter of Second Timothy, where this as
well as other crimes are declared an apostacy,
and the saints admonished to turn away from
them. This the saints are doing, and that in great
numbers too, and the separation will continue
until all the saints are again found united in strict
obedience to the Doctrines and Covenants of the
Charch.

This doctrine of a man having more wives
than one, is the cause which has induced the
twelve to put at defiance the ecclesiastical ar-
rangements of the Church, and what is equally
criminal, to do despite unto the moral excellence
of the Doctrines and Covenants of the Church,
setting up an order of things of their own in vio
lation o all the rules and regulations known to
the saints, and nowhere found in the Doctrines
and Covenants of the Church, but by the author-

# PROSPECTUS,

## EOR
The Latter Day Saints'
MESSSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

As much doubt still remains on the public mind, as to the true doctrine of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; the subscriber proposes to publish a paper in the city of Pittsburgh, for the purpose of relieving the public mind from all dubiety in relation to the received and acknowledged decrines of said church. The paper is to be entitled as above.

It will be the primary object of the editor to give a full and clear developement of all the doctrines of said church, carefully distinguishing between the true religious belief of said church and the strange doctrines which have crept in unawares, and are maintained by some who would fain make the public believe that they are the only legitimate authorities of the church whose claims shall be examined and exposed to the condemnation to which they are devoted by the doctrines and covenants which have been received, and on which the church was formed and organized.

In resuscitating the Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate; it is the intention of the subscriber to contend for the same doctrines,, order of church government and discipline, maintained by that paper when first published in Kirtland, Ohio.

It is to the public the subscriber must look for patronage to carry out his designs believing as he does, that the paper conducted, as he intends it shall be, on the broad principles of Christian charity, be sufficiently interesting to the reading public, whether they do or do not belong to said church, to secure the necessary patronage; and in this belief, submits his proposals to the public,

SIDNEY RIGDON.

TERMS The Latter Day Saints Messenger and Advocate will be published Semi-Monthly, in pamphlet form, containing sixteen royal octavo pages, at one dollar per annum; payable in advance, in all cases.

Any person or persons forwarding the subscription price for five copies, shall be entitled to one gratis, and for ten two, and soon in proportion.

All letters addressed to the editor must be post paid,

---

ity of pretended secret communications made to themselves in the Secret Chambers, unknown, to the Church only as they and some of their fol. lowers declare them, and these pretended secret communications, in direct contradiction to the written word contained in the Doctrine and Covenants of the Church..

These matters the saints are now investigating, and-not only in Nauvoo but in other places to avoid these investigations,, the twelve are getting up sham trials to stop the mouths of those who are determined to expose the corruptions of these transgressors. Let the saints look well to it. The time has come when the saints will have to come out and show themselves: the alternative with the saints is that they must either deny their faith or espouse the Spiritual Wife system and he taught by those who practise it, or else boldly and manfully join with those who have and are raising their voices against this most extraordinary of all doctrines, which is destroying the peace and sapping the foundation of the Church.

To satisfy the public that it was the Spiritual Wife system that caused our opponents at Nauvoo to oppose us, we give the following certificate, from a gentleman whose character stands too high for truth and veracity to be impeached by any man:

"I was at Nauvoo during all the time that Elder Sidney Rigdon was there on his last visit to that place, and am well acquainted with the cause of all the difficulties that existed, and now exist between him and the twelve and their adherents. It was said to me by many that they had no ob,jection to Elder Rigdon but his opposition to the Spiritual Wife system.

JOSEPH H. NEWTON."

We introduce this testimony to show that the twelve and their adherents, though they availed themselves of the circumstance of a number of the citizens of that place coming with us to Pittsburgh, to create an excitement against us, yet the whole was designed to guard against the disclosures which they had reason to fear would be made of the secret doctrines they were teaching at Nauvoo, and which they had openly denied in the world. They knew that if the true facts of the case were made known, that they inust appear in rather an unfavorable point of light before the public, having at various times and on various occasions denied the existence of such doctrine with all the solemnities of an oath. The) falsehood of such assertions are staring them in the face.

We felt it a duty we owed the public to say so much on this subject, in this number of our paper, with the intention to give the doctrine and practice under it an examination hereafter.
