# For the Messenger and Advocate.

Mr. Editor, Having returned a few days since, from a visit to Lake County, Ohio, in obedience to the request of many of our old acquaintances, in that part of the country, we are inclined to give a brief sketch of our journey, which occupied a little over three weeks.

In consequence of the bad condition of the roads, we were prevented from arriving as soon as we and our friends expected. In anticipations of our arrival at Kirtland, an appointment had been made for a meeting in the temple; on Sunday morning, the 16th of Feb, but the congregation had dispersed before our arrival, or a large number of them had dispersed. On our arrival we were welcomed by hundreds of our old acquaintances, with a warmth of feeling which clearly manifested that the ties of friendship were not broken. It had been upwards of seven years since we were in that part of the country, and great changes had taken place during our absence.

An appointment was made immediately on our arrival for meeting at candle light, and notwithstanding the night was very dark and the roads exceedingly bad, yet the temple was filled. It will seat about nine hundred persons --and we addressed a very attentive congregation, and probably as large a one as was ever gathered in that or any other part of the country, under similar circumstances. We made an appointment for the Tuesday evening following, and also the Thursday evening. On Tuesday evening again, to our great surprise, the house was filled. We again addressed the people, and again on the Thursday evening following. On Thursday evening we gave the history of Nauvoo, and the events that led to the death of the Smiths, which, of course, we traced to the introduction of the spiritual wife system; for all do know, that know anything about it, that it was the introduction of that system which led to the death of the Smiths, and that if that system had not been introduced they might have been living men to-day. We had a fair opportunity of setting before a large congregation the operations of that system, and its effect on the people of Nauvoo; showing that it was the inlet to all the corruptions which followed. Such as bogus money making, counterfeiting, stealing, lying, perjury, and a train of abominations. We set before the people the plans used by the devotees of this system to conceal their iniquity from public view their lying and perjuries, to ruin the characters of innocent persons, in order to hide their corruptions from the public eye. The people there had heard of all these abominations, but were not satisfied, and were very anxious for us to go there, in that they might know the truth of these reports. We think we can say with confidence that the people were all satisfied, and expressed to us great indignation at a people capable of such enormities.

An unexpected circumstance took place that evening, it was the arrival of brethren William Law and William E. McLellan, from Hampton, Rock Island County, Illinois. Brother Law addressed the congregation for some time, setting forth what he knew about the people and the affairs of Nauvoo; some of which were new to us. He settled the question forever on the public mind, in relation to the spiritual wife system, and the abominations concerning it. As Joseph Smith and others had attempted to get him into it, and in order to do so had made him acquainted with many things about it that we never knew before. The whole combined put the matter at rest, and the public mind, was quieted, and all doubts removed.

The next Sunday we lectured again in the temple to a large audience. The week following we received a request from the citizens of Painsville, to go there and deliver a lecture in that place, accordingly we went, and addressed a large and respectable congregation there. During the week we received a message from some of the citizens of Cleveland, informing us that if we would accept an invitation from the citizens of that place, and lecture there, we would receive it from some of the most-respectable inhabitants; with this request we were unable to comply.

We continued our lectures in Kirtland, and at the close we organized a church, and Hiram Kellogg was appointed presiding elder. During our stay there were lectures delivered by Dr. Samuel Bennett, and brethren Law and McLellan, all of which tended greatly to enlighten and settle the public mind.

We need not say that there were prejudices removed, for we did not find any to remove; the people were open, and willing to hear, and we received the kindest treatment at the hand of all with whom we had intercourse. The tongue of slander was still, and the voice of reproach was not heard. We found good feelings, and feel as if we left the same..

There was some nestling by a little band of spiritual wife folk ; they felt as if their darling system of religious libertinism was rather roughly handled. They had several secret meetings, and passed some resolutions to be published in the spiritual wife papers at Nau-

our conference, it has put our paper back for sev-
eral days; and as we are all anxious to make
preperations for the conference, we have con
cluded to passover the 1st of April No. and date
the next paper on the 15th of April By so.do-
ing we shall be able to give our subscribers the
proceedings of the conference at a very early
day and save ourselves much anxietv.
Our friends will lose nothing by this arrange-
ment, as they will receive their full compliment
of papers, (24 No's.)

No circumstance has occurred since the
days of the advent of Jesus Christ, more re
markable in its character, than the coming
forth of the Book of Mormon. More than four-
'teen years have now elapsed since this singular
*cord first emerged from its hiding place, di- given by inspiration of God is profitable, and
which indelibly stamp upon its pages, the im-
pression of eternal truth; yet it has hitherto
failed to excite that deep and general interest,
which the intrinsic importance of its contents
demand. We are not at a loss to determine
why it is so. This may be aptly styled the
artificial age. The opinions, the manners, tho
pursuits, nay even the religion is made for
show; men dare not think without a-precep
tor; it would indeed be at the eminent hazard
of the thousand and one diverse systems of
truth, should men once get it into their heads
that they were permited to exercise a little
thought. An unnatural morbid sentiment pre
vails, which effectually blocks up the avenues,
to the most valuable and exalted field of hu
man investigation; in the attainment of that
intelligence, which can only satisfy and fill
the "aching void, of the Immortal spirit that
is in man. "The Bible contains all that is
necessary for our salvation." The canon of
scripture is full." These are the maxims of
a race of zealous religionists, who propose to
evangelize the world, and bring about the de-
voutly to be desired condition of things, when
all shall know the Lord, from the least unto
the greatest." We do not impugn their mo
tives; but we altogether disallow the adequa
cy of their proposed plan of accomplishing
the object. The means are not equal to the
end. Is it not a fact that sects and parties are
multiplying annually, amongst Christians

ly in the divine authenticity of the Bible, and
that it contains all that is necessary for salva-
tion. In the name of all that is reasonable,
then, we ask, how is it possible that men shall
all see "eye to eye," by the full canon of
Scripture contained in the Bible? Solve me
this problem.

It is because we believe that all scripturo

because we receive the testimony of the Biole as verily true, we feject the anti-Christian and absurd notion, that the cannon of Scripture is complete. Atleast thirty inspired records and mentioned in the Bible, which are now no known to be extant! So that if the Bible contains all that is necessary to salvation, these were superorgatory works of inspiration, and Peter-did not understand the matter when he declared they were all profitable. Those who ho'd the maxim that the canon of scripture is complete in the Bible, also hold another max. im equal in absurdity with it, and a palpable contradiction in itself to the other two.

The Bible is the only rule of faith and practice. If the Bible contains all, that is necessary for salvation, and if nothing is to be believed that is not found in the Bible, how came either of these erroneous dogmas into existence? Certainly neither of them are found in the Bible. So far from it, the whole genius and spirit of that inspired record, is diametrically opposed to the imposition of such a moral incubus. If there is any principle taught in the Bible, it is that God never had a people existing on the earth, whom he acknowledged that he did not reveal himself to them, made known to them his will, and poured upon them the spirit of inspiration. It is a virtual rejection of the Bible, to say that it contains all that is necessary to the salvation of man. It is in effect saying that the Bible is unworthy our credence. Amos declares, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveals his secret unto his servants the prophets." Solomon says, "Where there is no vision the people perish!" David says, "Truth shall spring out of the earth." John, in his sublime history of future events, shown him by the angel says, "I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell upon earth; to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people."

The Bible, in short, contains a string of prophecies and promises, with regard to a future glorious epoch in the history of the human family, when God shall reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth; and it is by that means alone that the knowledge of God can ever cover the earth, as the waters cover the sea.

What then is the Book of Mormon? It is by the a true record of a branch of the house of Israel

---

of the ancient inhabitants of this continent; and to whom the Savior personally appeared and administered, after fulfilling his work at Jerusalem. Know ye not how he told the Jews, other sheep I have which are not of this fold, hem also I must bring in;" at this time, that there may be one fold and one shepherd." You will observe it was a branch of the house of Israel to which he there refers, for he distincly says, "I am not sent but to he lost sheep of the house of Israel." The Redeemer's mission, then, had respect to another branch of the house of Israel, not of the Jewish fold. The Book of Mormon relates what that mission was, and how it was accomplished. It is an additional evidence of the truth of the gospel, or God's plan of saving men, in contradistinction to all the systems invented by men or devils. To the honest inquirer after truth, it is therefore of greater value than the riches of the whole world. It is surrounded by a thousand testimonies of its truth, and the best of all is, it leads those who follow its direction to the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world;" to the fountain of all wisdom and knowledge, that they may drink deep of the waters of life, and be satisfied; that they henceforth live "holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners."

We shall revert to this subject again.

Is it true that we have given us in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, a perfect example of obedience to the principles of eternal salvation? By imitating the pattern which he has left us by treading the path which his footsteps have hallowed, who was the way, the truth, and the life, we can enter the holiest of all whither the forerunner hath for us entered.

Although it is necessary we should make our ingress by the door, into the sheepfold, that we may be constituted logal heirs according to the promise that is not all which is requisite to secure the "inheritance of the saints in light." It is not enough that we yield obedience to the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, unless we go on unto perfection, "by patient continuance in well doing unto the end."

The standard of excellence which is erected by the Saviour, is nothing short of the perfection of Deity. "Be ye perfect, even as your

# Heads Under

And just now I would like to ask brother Turley a question. Pray where did you get that five dollar counterfeit bill from which you passed upon me about three days before I left Naproo! Can you answer that question, Brother Turley! Now, brother Parley. I wish you would take little time, and answer some of my questions, but I pray do not call it all foul and malicious falsehoods for we that do know better will not believe you.

There is one declaration of brother P's worthy of notice. He says those that publish and those that patronize the Messenger and Advocate their object is to procure the murder of all the men, women, and children of the saints!

Stop, not so fast brother Parley, do you not know that i have three daughters in the devoted city, Nauvoo, so that I am satisfied in my own mind, that the above charge is as destitute of truth as it is void of common sense.

Not but that brother P. is a man possessed of good common sense, but he makes a wrong use of it sometimes. For instance, you have essayed to take hold of the radder of the ship, instead of being employed in trimming her!

Don't forget the rocking boat, brother Parley!

And do you really aim at innocence, virtue, and truth? If this be the truth, why then do you teach one set of principles in public and teach different principles in private, and practice them too? You know, as God lives, this is TRUTH!

You further say, if the Saints at Pittsburgh had any sense of law or justice left, to say nothing of mercy or humanity, they would prove the saints guilty, and only destroy them according to law.

I would ask you another question, Did you know that brother German, formerly of New York, has been driven to insanity in consequence of his wife Susan having left him? Did you know that I saw said Susan leave Cincinnati, on my way to this place in Nov. last, in company with G. J. Adams, for Nauvoo? Did you know that I occupied said Adams' berth on board the steamer the two nights I remained in Cimcinnati; but where he slept I did not SEE! Question, Did or did not your quorum send a man out to preach after the high council at Nauvoo had cut him off from the church, upon his own confession, and the testimony of a young woman from Jersey, formerly from New York, she having the fruit of their illicit intercourse in her arms at the time! This man is now considered to be in good standing among you, and is now, I believe, preaching in the east, and is since married to another woman, but refused to marry the object of his deception. She said that he had promised to marry her. This was Sparks! Does, not the Book of Covenants expressly say, that all contracts of marriage shall be held sacred and inviolate? Your own family told me of a young woman that was set completely beside herself in consequence of a disappointment of the above nature; but out of

to respect to the young woman I do not give her name. The man, who is a high priest, is still in good standing in the church! Such fellows should be treated with contempt by every honest man and woman.

In conclusion, I would say, that whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are honest, and whatsoever things are in accordance with the pure principles of eternal truth, let all these be held up in broad relief for the examination of all mank..d, for truth will bear its own weight. The principles of eternal truth require not the covering of falsehood to sustain them. And that man who resorts to stratagem and falsehood, for the purpose of imposing his principles upon virtuous females, leading astray the honest and unsuspecting into bye and forbidden paths, bringing ruin and disgrace upon whole families. These are they that are sons of Belial. They may talk about their sealing power, and the fullness of the priesthood being committed unto them, and have their having women sealed up to them, (the epsiles) for the purpose of exalting them to kingdoms, principalities, and powers!

SISTERS' I tell you, as God lives, your seallings are calculated to bind the fetters of darkness upon you, and to bring you down to the chambers of death! I call upon you therefore, in the name of the Lord, to break asunder from you the bands that bind you, to this system of things. Believe their teachings no longer, and frown such men from your society. For those are they that cannot become saviours upon Mount Zion! These are they that cannot be numbered with the one hundred and forty and tour thousand, these are they that cannot stand to see the Savior come, these are they that cannot have part in the first resurrection, these are they that must suffer the torments of hell. I therefore exhort every honest man, woman, and child to come out from among them. I, also, in the name of the God of my fathers, call upon the husband of my daughter, Wmr Pitt, in the city of Nanvoo, to come out of her, and bring with him his wife and my other two daughters, and God will bless you, for the Lord, not me, has spoken this word. In a word I call upon all my eastern friends, living in and about Nauvoo, to come out of her. Among those that stand foremost of my friends, are John Wollf and family, and Albert Gregory and family, L. R. Foster, and Dr. John Beruhisel.

After the close of the conference in this city, I hope to visit my old friends in the city of New York, if advisable. And I pray my heavenly father to bless the saints, and preserve them from the power of those who are seeking your eternal destruction.

I remain yours, &c.

# HOPE IN GOD.

In thee, dear Lord, my pensive soul respires,
Thow art the fulness of my choice desiresi
Thou art that sacred spring, where waters burst
In streams to him, that seeks with holy thirst;
Thrice happy man, thrice happy thirst to bring
The fainting soul to so, so sweet a spring;
Thrice happy he, whose well resolved breast.
Expects no other aid, no other rest;
Thrice happy he, whose downy age hath been
Reclaim'd by scourges from the prince of sin.
And early season'd with the taste of truth,
Remembers his Creator in his youth

Even as the needle that directs the hour,
Touch'd with the loadstone, by the the secre power.
Of hidden nature, points upon the pole;
Even so the wavering powers of my soul,
Touch'd by the virtue of thy Spirit, flee
From what is base, and print alone to thee.
When I have faith to hold thee by the hand,
I walk securely, and methinks I stand
More firm than Atlas; but when I forsake.
The safe protection of thine arm, I quake
Like wind shaked reeds, and have no strength at all,
But like a vine, the prop cut down, 1 fall.

That makes the virtue strong.

"I have but little," never say,
"Twill not avail to give;"
A penny if you give to-day
Will make the dying live.

It is the spirit-not the gold
Upon the waters cast-
That will return a hundred fold,
To cheer and bless the last.
Then give a trifle cheerfully,
From out thy little store,
With interest it will come to thee,
When thou wilt need it more.

In Nauvoo, Hancock County, Ill on the 15th February last, Mr. Asa Works sen. aged 83 years, after a lingering sickness of about six months. Mr. Works was one of the few remaining soldiers of the revolution, who fought under General Washington. Full -of zeal for his country and his home he enter- ed the army at the early age of eleven years, and was wounded at the battle of Monmouth, New Jersey, and in the great cause of inde- pendence had to endure many hardships and privations. About three years since he became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of
