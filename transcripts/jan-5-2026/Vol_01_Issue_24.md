# ESSAY ON THE GOSPEL.

BY S. RIGDON,

Continued from page 359.

There is one thing necessary to know in order to have a correct knowledge of the gospel; it is, that it was, and is, and ever will be the same; that it is as immutable as God himself, or Jesus the Savior, and that the gospel is the scheme of life and salvation; and there was not nor will not be any other; it is that scheme of things by which all that are saved, will be saved, and all who are now saved were saved by it. The apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Ephesians, Ist chapter from the 3rd to the 11 verse, gives us the following account of the scheme of life and salvation, which he promulged in his day to the generation among whom he lived, and to whom the Lord sent him. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; wherein he hatli abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence; having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he has purposed in himself; that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him."

In the foregoing quotation the apostle gives us an outline of the order of things, which he proclaimed to the people of his day, which he said he had not received of man, nor by man; but by revelation of Jesus Christ. Galatians 1: 11,12, "But I certify you brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man: for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."

The account then which the apostle gives of the proclamation which he proclaimed_to the world is, that the same thing which he received by immediate revelation from Jesus Christ, was a scheme of which had originated in eternity, before the world was, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual bless-ings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world." Ephesians 1: 3, 4. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, to himself. 5 verse. That is, before the foundation of the world. No language need be plainer than this, that is, that God before he framed the world, had laid the scheme of life and salvation, and before he formed Adam's dust into man, he had predestinated that the human family should be made children to himself, through Jesus Christ, and all this was fixed before the foundation of the world; and this is what Paul had revealed unto him to proclaim to the uncircumcision, as well as Peter to the circumcision. But it was in Jesus Christ that men were to be made children to God, or that God made children to himself out of the apostate race of man. "He hath chosen us in him in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins wherein he hath abounded toward us, or in him he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence." In all these instances it is in him, not out of him, that men are to receive blessings, and to become sons of God.

This is in perfect accordance with what this same apostle says in the epistle to the Galatians, when speaking of Abraham, and the gospel proclaimed to him, 3 chapter and 8 verse: "And the scripture, foseeing that God would justify the heatlien through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, in thee shall all nations be blessed." The promise to which the apostle alludes is found in the book of Genesis 12; 1, 2, 3. Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred and from thy father's house, unto a land that I shall shew thee of: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee, and by curse them that curse thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. In the 22 chapter 15, 16, 17 and 18 verses, the promise reads thus: "And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, by myself I have sworn saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessings I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shaft all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast done these things."
