# THE TEMPLE.

For the more perfect understanding of the promises and designs of God in the work of the last days, we will devote a few remarks to the elucidation of is subject.

The Lord has been pleased to make known to us, that his design in the work of the last day, is to raise up a people who shall be pure in heart, who will contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints, why through faith in the promises of God, will overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil; and enterinto the rest of God. "Therefore, let your hearts be, comforted, for all things shall work together for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the church: for I will raise up unto me a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness; and all that call on the name of the Lord and keep his commandments, shall be saved; even so: Ainen."-§ 95, last part of f 4.- And what most intimately concerns us is the promise, that this generation shall not all for pass away, before all these things shall be fulfilled!

It is a truth, which has not been-duty-ap.preciated by the children of men, in any age, that the government of God is conducted upon fixed and immutable principles, which cannot be departed from; the prophecies and promises are all delivered, and do all rest, upon that indestructible basis. In subserviency to her, that eternal and unalterable law, the purposes of God in the latter day work are to be con-sidered.

Has the most high God chosen certain men, as instruments by which to fulfil his purposes? It is only by their conformity to the celestial law, that they can possibly maintain their standing and authority before God. How repeatedly in the history of the hu nan family. dowe find men designated as chosen instru-ments, for the accomplishment of the work of the Almighty, who are finally themselves marked out as fit subjects for exemplary punishment. So in the revelations of heaven be to mankind in the last days, we find certain men chosen of God, and-invested-with-power and authority to do his work, warned to take heed lest they violate the immutable law of righte usness, and are themselves cut off from the earth as transgressors. Not only do we find Gud making known this his inflexible pur-pose, but we see it really exemplified before our eyes.

This principle applies with unmitigated force to every department of the work of God. It-is only by obedience to the law of the co-

lestial kingdom, that we can be in any degree the recipients of its blessings and glories, as individuals, or communities.

If these remarks are, what we deem them to be, incontrovertibly true; we are prepared for a correct understanding of the manner in which any measure must be carried out, to render it acceptable to God.

On three several occasions, in our own day, the God of Israel has given commandment to build a house unto his name, that He the most High may dwell therein. Our_design leads us particularly to treat of the houses-comman-ded to be built at Nauvoo. As illustrative of the mode in which a Temple of the Lord should be reared, we will quote from $.82, 1 4 and 5.

"And inasmuch as my people build an house unto me, in the name of the Lord, and do not sufler any unclean thing to come into it, that it be not defiled, my glory shall rest upon it; yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it, and all the pure in heart that shall come into it, shall see God: but it it be defiled I will not come into it, and my glory, shall-not be there, for I will not come into un-holy temples..

And now behold if Zion do these things, she shall prosper and spread herself and be-come very glorious, very great, and very ter-rible; and the nations of the earth-shall-honor to her, and shall say. surely Zion is the city of our God; and surely Zion cannot fall, neither be moved out of her place, for God is there, and the hand of the Lord is there, and he hath sworn by the power of his might to be her sal-vation, and her high tower: therefore verily thus saith the Lord let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion, THE PURE IN HEART: therefore let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn: for behold and-lo, vengeance cometh speedily upon the ungodly, as the whiriwind, and who shall escape it: the Lord's scourge shall pass over by night and by day: and the report thereof shall vex all people; yet, it shall not be stayed until the Lord come: for the indig-nation of the Lord is kindled against their abominations, and all their wicked works: nevertheless Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her, but if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will visit her ac-cording to all her works: with sore affliction; with pestilence; with plaguer with sword;-with vengeance; with devouring fire; never-theless, let it be read this once in their ears, that I the Lord have accepted of their offering; land if she sin no more, none of these things

to deliver them over to the buffetings of satan and denounce them as fit subjects for a never ending hell.

Christ never imposed a creed upon his followers, but he left them free and untrammelled, and this is one of the excellencies of the gospel. It presents grand and comprehensive truths for the acceptance of man, and not binding the mind to subscribe to any certain form of words, it leaves him free to think and judge for himself. The bigoted opinions and creeds of men, to which those who style themselves christians adhere, are unfounded in scripture and present an insuperable barrier to the progress of man in wisdom and divine intelligence. Instead of subjecting their creeds to the bible, the bible is in fact subordinate to them, and hence, instead of having "one Lord, one faith and one baptism," we have in christendom many faiths and many baptisms.

The religious world has come to act upon the same principle as the political, and the grand object in both is popularity and power. The young man attaches himself to a political party, often without examining into the soundness of its principles, bacause his father or the friends of his youth belong to it. Thus he commits himself, and though he may af erwards find the doctrines he has embraced to be incorrect, yet-he-seldom-dares-renounce-er-For and espouse the truth, because publicity opinion holds a lash of tyranny over every man's back who has the honesty and moraling courage to do so. So it is in making prose lytes to the creeds of the day. An excitement is got up the fears of man are appealed to with powerful-effect-his-friends-and-relations come around him, persuading and exhorting until finally he commits himself. Without a previous acquaintance with the scriptures, he subscribes to a creed, and when he comes to read the bible, if he reads it at all, he bends every thing to meet the peculiar doctrines which he has espoused. Without looking to the teachings and precepts of the bible, as the foundation of his faith, he pins his hopes of future salvation upon the articles of some narrow minded creed, and hence has_arisen the bigotry, superstition and dogmatic spirit which characterizes the age in which we live. - Here we see the very reason, why those are ridiculed and persecuted, who are contending with a deep, abiding earnestness for the faith -once-delivered-to-the-saints; who_claim_that the gospel brings with it the same gifts and blessings now, that it ever did to those who have practiced it in its purity, and obeyed faithfully its requirements.

The idea that God will communicate his will by revelation in this day, to those who dilligently seek him, is repugnant to the feel-irgs of the religious world, and hence it is scouted with disdain and contempt. It comes in contact with the fine span theories of the learned, with the lofty notions and deep

grounded prejudices of distinguished theolo-gians; and priesteraft finding itself in danger, sends forth the hue and cry of "Delusion."

The gospel, as taught by the Savior and his apostles is something entirely new.-- When it was first promulgated, the Pharisee, the Sadducee, the learned and the noble opposed its progress, and even put its author to a cruel and ignominious death. And why was this? Because they saw that their long. cherished institutions and their pride, must melt away before its blazing truths. Thus it has been the fate of truth always to meet with opposition. Columbus for eight years strug-gled with the ridicule and prejudice of the age in which he lived. For believing that the earth was of a globular form, and that land could be found by sailing due west from Europe, he was called an idiot; his idea was scouted as chimerical; but he finally proved to the world that he was not crazy, when opportunity was given him to do so.

Ignorance is the mother of error, and when men do not and will not examine for them-selves, they cannot have certain knowledge, Truth must be sought to be found and known. and to those who seek her diligently and with pure motives, she is near at hand. He who searches with full purpose of heart, can read it in the volume of nature, for every where can-be-found the impress of the finger of Dei-ty. There is a spirit whispering around the mountain tops, and echoing through the wind-ing dells, whose voice is eloquent with its teachings. Its voice can be heard in the whistling of the wind, the rage of the storm, to the plunge of the cataract, and in the roar of the ocean. But more plainly can truth be read in the scriptures: and though he be a wayfaring man. who searches, if he will cast aside his prejudices and examine with an honest heart, he shall find that which will give him joy, and fill the soul with gladness unut-terably full. He will find directions there, by following which, he can hold communion with his God, experience perfect liberty, en. joy that consolation which shall buoy him up in the darkest hour of tribulation aud adversi-ty, and secure to himself immortality beyond the grave. If he would find a perfect model after which to fashion his character, let him not search for it amid the ranks of men for it will be in vain; but let him study and imitate, the character of the Redeeiner of the world.- Here he will find perfection, and a model after which whoever patterns, shall build upon a foundation firmer than the monarch's throne and as durable as the Rock of Ages.

# ON PRAYER.

"Prayer is the souls sincere desire,

Uuered or unexpressed;

The motion of a hidden fire,

That trembles in the breast."

Amidst the strife of contending elements which the man of faith is compelled to en-counter, in his warfare against corruption and erior, and in beha f of vir ue and godliness; there is one infallible source of never failing consolation, always open to him where he car. confidently resort, as a sure refuge in every time of trouble; he is there invited to a feast of the spiritual dainties, love, joy, and peace.

"Ask, and ye shall receive;" "knock and it shall he opened unto you," are the terms of the gracious invitation.

O. Hyde wishes it distinctly understood, that, if Prest. Rigdon should ever wish to come into THEIR Church, he could not expect their confidence for his character would THEN be EN-TIRELY destroyed. So say we. Mr. Hyde hav-ing had some experience in such matters ought certainly to be a good judge..

# INFLUX OF JEWS TO THE HOLY LAND.

The influlx of Jews to the Holy Land has been very great of late. There is said to be no more room in Jeruralem for them; they have al ready spread over a part of the Turkish quar ter. Jaffa has been selected by them for the establishment of a Jeshiba, and several rab bis have been appointed for that purpose. Many new comers have settled at Jaffa and other places along the coast.-Sat. Courier of Dec. 28.

The return of the Jews to the land of their fore-fathers, the land which God swore to Abraham to give him, and his seed after him for an everlasting inheritance; is to us ar event fraught with the most thrilling interest. It affords satisfactory evidence, that the "work of the Father" has in truth commene ed, to the fu filing of the promises, prophicies. and covenants, made to the house of Israel. It presents a splended refutation, of all the spiritualizing doginas of the commentators of prophecy-ard demonstrates the literal tul filment, of the preditions of those men who "spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost."

The gathering of the Jews to the land of Palestine, furnishes additional and incontesta ble evidence, of the truth of the book of Mer mon, speaking to to us with the irresistable el oquence of eternal truth, it tells us, that the

epoch has arrived, when God his stranga work will perform-the set time to favor Zion has come. Take the following among many similar passages;

"And it shall come to pass that all lyings, and deceiviugs, and envyings, and strifes, and priesterafs and whoredoms, shall be done away. For it shall come to pass saith the Father, that at that day, whosoever will nt repent and come unto my beloved Son, them will I ent off from among my people, O house of Isra 1; and I will execute venge ance and fury upon them, even as upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.

"But if they will repent, and hearken unto my words, and harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and they shall come in unto the covenant, and be num-bered among this the remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for their inher-fitance, and they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob; and also, as many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall be called the New Jerusalem; and then shall they assist my people that they may be gathered in, who are cattered upon all the face of the land, in un-to the New Jerusalem. And then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and I also will be in the midst, and then shall she work of the Father commence, at that day even when this gospel shalt be preached-among the rennant of this people. Verily I say unto you, at that day shall the work of ny Father-comence among all the dispersed of my people; yea, even the tribes which have been lost, which the Father hath led away out of Jerusalem. Yea the work shall cmmence among all the dispersed of my people, with the Father, to prepare the way whereby they may come unto me, that they may call on the Father in my name; yea, and then shall they work commence, with the Father, among all nations, in preparing the way whereby his people may be gathered home to the land of their inheritance. And they shall go out from all nations; and they shall not go out in has nor go by flight; for I will go before them, saith the Father, and I will be their rearward. From the above quotation it will be seen, that the inhabitants of the American conti pent are as vitally interested in the work of God of the last days, as any people can be.-

the perpetuity of their national existence de-De ds upon their action in the premises.-

There is no mistake on this point. The cloud of witnesses is too great, their evidence too positive, to admit of doubt here.

We will refer to a single declaration of the Son of God; "Jerusalem shall be trodden lown of the Gentiles, until THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES GENTILES DE LULFILED." This is tanta-

mount to an unequivocal declaration, tha
when Jerusalem shall cease to be trodder
down of the Gentiles the times of the Gen
tiles is fulfiled! This conclusion is startling.
but irresistable, are we not then justified in
saying, that the gathering of the Jews, iss
momentious event, pregnant with marvellous
result?

Although the Jews as a body rejected their
Redeemer at his first advent, their course on
h's second advent, will be a very different
one. Why are the Jews returning to the
land of Judea? because they believe the pro
phets; they credit the testimony of Zecharial
who tells thein, that their King, when he shal!
coine to glorify the house of Israel, shall de
scend on the precise spot from which he as
cended; "And his feet shall stand in that day
upon the mount of Olives which is before Je
rusalem on the east, and the mount of Olive
shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the
east and toward the west, and there shall be a
very great valley; and half the mountain shall
remove toward the north, and half of it toward
he south." * * * "And the Lord my
God shall come, and all the saints with thee."

"CARRY OUT THE MEASURES OF
JOSEPH SMITH."
As there is much foolish declamation on
this subject, by those whose zeal is not accor
ding to knowledge, we wish to put the matter
in a correct position.

What measures of Joseph is it desirable to
carry out? We reply, those only which are ac
cording to godliness. If we have shewn that
Joseph Smith departed from the living God.
that like Divid and Solomon he contracted
whoring spirit, and that the Lord smote hiu
for this thing cut him off from the earth.-
Who that is wise would approve of the carry
ing out of such measures?

Those man worshipers who contend for the
measures of Joseph Smith, irrespective of the
law of God, are in love with the "spiritual wife
system." 'T's such a great and glorious doe
trin, to use their own language, as we have
heard-them-express themselves, such a darl
ing principle, so much in accordance with
their feelings, so exactly suited to their na
ture, that they cannot give give it up if it leads
them to hell. No marvel then that God has
sent them strong delusion that they should be
lieve a lie, that they might be damned, be
cause they believed not the truth, but had plea
sure in unrighteousness. It is very apparent
that Paul had his eye on these lustful charac
ters, at this precise time too, for he says it
would take place in the gathering together of
the saints, prior to the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ. See 2d 'Theas. 24 chap.

This ranting about the measures of Joseph
Smith is the ebullition of apostacy, it lias no
reference to the law of God. Itisa false footing,
Ja sandy foundation, a broken reed at the best.
The spirit of God would dictate a very differ
ent course. The first inquiry of the prosses
sor of the spirit of God would be, what doth
The Lord require at my hand? what are the
provisions of the law of God relative to the
natter to be acted upon? There is no resting
place short of the word of God, for the inan of
faith.

To shew most c'early that the phrase we
quote is instigated by an apostate spirit, we
nust observe that the law of God given
through Joseph Smith is discarded entirely.
The organization of the church of God, as re
ceived by revelation through Joseph, is
hrown away as valueless; and all that is real.
ly contended for, is the loathsome, disgrace.
ful, and destructive "spiritual wife" doctrine.
The truth is these revellers wish to skuik
ff. on the credit of the measures of Joseple
Smith, we shall permit them to do no such
thing; but shall strip them of their false cov
ering, and when divested of that, you will
find in legible characters written upon the
brow-"APOSTATE"

If Joseph Smith sinned which he did, the
Lord has cut him off from his stewardship,
and put another in his place. We have too
nuch respect for the good which he was in
strumental in accomplishing, to permita com
bination of men who disregard the principles
of truth and virtue, to shelter themselves from
the odium of acts committed since his death,
under the mantle of Joseph Smith,

# THE APOSTATES AND REBELLIOUS
## SPIRITS AT NAUVO0.
It is an unpleasant task for one to dwell up
on the depravity of his fellow beings, and ex

fany individual, it is well always to keep in

shalt see clearly to cast the mote from thy

And certain it is, that nothing but a sense
of duty, now prompts me to exposes some of

of many at Nauvoo. Hoping that some who
are attempting to hold up the hands, and sus

they stand, profit by what they witness, and

FOR THE MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.
## A SONG OF THANKSGIVING AND
## PRAISE, FOR THE SAINTS.
Thanksgiving to the Lord of life!-to him all
praises be,
Who from the hands of evil men hath set his
people free;
All praise to him before whose power the
mighty are afraid,
Who takes the crafty in the snare, which for
the poor is laid!

Sing, oh, my soul, rejoicingly, on evening's
twilight calm
Uplift the loud thanksgiving-pour forth the
grateful psalm;
Let all pure hearts with me rejoice, as did the
saints of old,
When of the Lord's good angel the rescued
Peter told.

And weep and howl, ye evil priests and mighty
men of wrong,
The Lord shall smite the proud and lay His
hand upon the strong.
Wo to the wicked rulers in His avenging hour!
Wo to the wolves who seek the flocks to raven
and devour:

But let the humble ones arise, -the poor in heart
be glad,
And let the mourning ones again with robes of
praise be clad,
For he who coolel the furnace, and smoothed
the stormy-wave,
And tamed the Chaldean lions, is mighty still
to save!
