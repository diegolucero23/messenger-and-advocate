ESSAY ON FUTURE EVENTS.

We have the following curious savings about John the Baptist. See Matthew, 11th chapter and 12th verse: "And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force." There are many other passages in the scriptures, that may throw light on to these sayings. It is said in the 13th verse: "For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John." And then these sayings follow in the 14th verse: "And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come." By these sayings of the Savior; it is to be infered that the Jews understood that the law was to cease when Elias came, and the prophets had thus testified and from that time the kingdom of heaven was to be proclaimed. In the 1st chapter of John's gospel, from the 19th to the close of the 23d verse we have the follow, ing: And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask hin, who art thou? And he confessed, and denied not: but confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked him, what then? art thou Elias? and he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, no. Then said they unto him, who art thou? that we way give an answer to them that sent us: what sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias." John is here said to deny being "the Christ," or "Elias," or "that prophet." From the inquiries of the Pharisees bere made. we learn that the Jews expected a Christ," an "Elias," and another messenger here called "that prophet." Some have found a difficulty between the saying of the Savior here, and that in Matthew the 11th chapter and 14th verse, where the Savior says of John: "If ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come;" and yet John says to the Pharisees: "I am not Elias." Let those who think they see a difficulty, mark, that Christ said, John was the Elias if they would receive it; if they would not receive it. John would not be the Elias, of John of course said he was not "Elias," after it was manifest the Jews would reject him.

In accordance with the prevailing opinton among the Jews, that at the time the restorer came, the law would cease: it was said that the law and the prophets were until John, and after that, the kingdom of heaven was preach-ed. See Luke 16th chapter and 16th verse:

"The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preach-ed, and every man presseth into it." By this, the kingdom of heaven was not only preached, but every man pressed into it. When John came, he cried, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;" "repent, therefore, and believe the glad tidings.". It was also said ton to the Jews, that the kingdom of heaven was in them or among them, and yet after that time, James said, the kingdom was yet-future. All these sayings are easily reconciled, when we see the subject as the Savior and apostles By did. In view of all this, it was said, the kingdom of heaven suffered violence," since the days of John the Baptist, thus informing the Jews, that that which they looked for had been preached to them since the first com-mencement of John's ministry, and had been proclaiming to them ever since; and notwith-standing all their desires for the kingdom to come, and their glorying in brilliant anticipa-tion of the glory they should receive when the kingdom was established it had received nothing but violence at their hands, and that from the commencement of its proclamation till then, and that the violence they were then inflicting on John and on the Savior, was against their long expected and desired kingdom of heaven, John being the "Elias" who had the power, and the only one who had, to establish the kingdom with Israel, this being his mission to the Jews, and the reason why he was more than a prophet. Every violence offered to John, was violence against the kingdom of heaven promised the Jews, on condi-tion that they would receive the messenger who came with power to Testore the kingdom to them.

The Jews, long before John's mission, had violated many, yea, nearly all the command-ments of God delivered to them, but they and never had offered violence to the kingdom of heaven, until Jobon came proclaiming it; after that their rebellion and violence was against the kingdom of heaven, and their violence against Jesus, was also against the kingdom of God, notwithstanding their former iniqui-afty, if they had received John, they would have rejectgot the pardon of their sins, and been restorel to the favor of heaven; hut when they did violence to him, their last ray of hope per-ished; for on obtaining the kingdom, their only hope rested, and when they did violence to John, they did violence to their last hope, and their downfall was certain. In view of all these things. Jesus says in the 23d chap-

# For the Messenger and Advocate.

The generation in which we live, is one that is admired by the inhabitants of the same, more than all generations from the creation of Adam till the present time. Yea, the Proph ets of old looked down through the vista of time, in vision, and beheld the great work of the Lord to be accomplished in this generation. Yea, the Lord has spoken by the mouth of his servants the Prophets, that he would com- mence to do a great and marvellous work among the inhabitants of the earth in the last days, which will cause the wisdom of the wise men of the earth to perish, and the un- derstanding which they gain from the world shall be hid, because the Lord has said by the mouth of his servants the Prophets, that his power shall be made known in the last days for the salvation of Israel.

And this shall be done by the Lord giving unto his servants precept upon precept, and line upon line, that they may teach the child- ren of men the way which they can escape the judgments of God, which is coming on the earth. Therefore, repent; O ye inhabitants of the earth, that you may escape the wrath of God, for the day of his judgments in the earth has commenced; and who shall be able to stand! why those who receive precept upon precept, and line upon line from the God of heaven.

The inhabitants of the earth may cry peace, peace, and say all things are well with us, for we are walking in the old paths, but we will not have precept upon precept, and line upon line, for the bible is all the revelations the Lord is going to give us, but know for assurity all ye inhabitants of the earth, it will be by the power of God being revealed unto us that will cause us to stand in these days, for the things which have come upon the earth these last two months, are the judgments which are spoken of by the Prophets, that should come on the earth in the last days. Therefore, repent, O ye inhabitants of the earth, and obey the gospel of the Kingdom of heaven, for the judgments of God will not stop, but they will increase year after year; yea, kingdom will arise agains: kingdom, na- tion against nation, and state against state; yea, the nations of the earth will be in one elamor of war. Now know for assurity, O ye inhabitants of the earth, that the Son of God will make his second advent to the earth when the inhabitants of the earth will be at war one with the other; yea, in that day the power of God will be revealed to his servants. The Lord has said through his servants the Prophets that he will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord.

Now my readers, I have said some things about the judgments of God covering the earth, and darkness the minds of the people, and I said it will be by the revelation of Jesus that we will be able to stand amongst the wreck of nations; and I said repent and believe the gospel of the Kingdom of heaven, now I de- sire to point out to you the way that is laid down in the Scriptures, that you may escape the judgments that are coming on the earth, and be saved in the Kingdom of heaven.

The Apostle Paul said in his days, to the saints at Rome, there is therefore now no con- demnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

By the above saying of Paul, I understand all who are not in Christ Jesus are condemned; but Paul said the spirit of life which he ob- tained in Christ Jesus, made him free from the law of sin and death. I understand Paul to say that the spirit of life is only obtained in Christ Jesus, which freed him from the law of sin and death, and made him an heir of the kingdom of God, Paul says more about the spirit of life; now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his.

St. John tells us in the 3d chapter of his Gospel, that Christ said to Nicodemus, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life; for God sent not his son into the world to con- demn the world, but that the world through him might be saved; he that believeth in him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he has not be- lieved in the name of the only begotten Son."

Here we see, that he that believeth not the words of the only begotten Son of God, is con- demned. Moreover, Jesus says, "For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God." And again, Jesus said, when he was in the flesh, "The words which ye hear are not mine, but the father's which sent me;" and Jesus said to the Jews, "I come not to domine own will, but the will of him that sent me;" and also Jesus answered them, and said, " My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent one me. I am aware that the people in this gen- eration do not look at these things as they read, for if they should they would under- stand just what they mean, and that is what Jesus said to the Jews about the will of his father, that if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. By this saying we understand the people were taught to do the commandments of God, and by so doing, they had a promise of knowing whether the doctrine be of God, or of man. This was the privilege the people had in the days of Christ, and the apostles, and the same privi- lege is granted to this generation, inasmuch as God is unchangeable the same now as in the

## WILLIAM HUTCHINGS.

We have received another letter from Broth-
er Hutchings, dated, Boston, May 19, 1845,
by which we learn the Church in that city has
attended to the ordinances of the Kingdom of
Heaven with glorious results, as will be seen
from the following extract.

"A meeting was appointed at my house for
washing.and anointing. I prepared all things,
and on Monday evening the brethren met, and
I commenced counseling them not to do any
thing but by the Spirit of God, and let the meet-
ing be dictated by it; and then several prayers
went around with great feeling, while the table
with the emblems of the Lord's Supper was in
our midst; all looked sublime. We then stood
around the table which the oil was placed up
on, and lifted our hands to Heaven, and in
solemn prayer consecrated the oil; after which
we prepared to an adjoining room, one by one,
to wash and anoint till all were washed and
anointed; while the rest of the brethren were
in prayer and exhortation. After this there was
a brother felt to go and be baptized; and came
back and received his washing and anointing.
The brethren all but two remained at the house
in prayer duting baptism. After this we stood
up and confessed, and covenanted together to
stand by each other, in all righteousness, dur-
ing our lives; also dedicated ourselves and
families, and all that we had to God, all seal-
ing the covenant with a loud amen. We also
covenanted to do all we could to bring in the
rest of God, in the presence of God, with up-
lifted hands to Heaven; and while in the at-
titude of this covenant, as we did at Confer-
ence, about to say amen, something appeared
before me like a bright cloud, and my speech
failed me, and my tongue began to flutter
like a leaf among the leaves, and in this
cloud there appeared to be a centre, and in that
centre the Son of God; I did not see the whole
form of a personage, but a glorious light; and
I talked for some minutes in an unknown
tongue, which I never knew; and my discourse
seemed to be directed to this personage in the
cloud. In a few minutes I found myself with
my brethren amaze amazed. We then partook of
the Lord's Supper, when such a glory was
felt to be over, and around us, and in us, as I
never realized here. Brother Hardy, Brother
Hutchings and Brother Wingate took each
other by the hand, while Brother Martin, as a
father amongst us, with the younger brethern
in sympathy acknowledged to each other, if
at any time they had hort each other's feelings,
they were sorry, and would never, while the
world stands, do it again, God being their help.
ter. With burning love as the heart of one man,
at half past twelve we adjourned."

We make the following extracts from El-
der Benjamin Stafford's Letter addressed to
this family, who writes from Jamestown Chet-
auque county, New York, under date of May
20, 1845: "I take this opportunity accord
ing to promise, to write you, having been ab.
sent from home two weeks, my health is
good. You will want to know how the Lord
has prospered me since I left. I traveled
twelve miles the first afternoon, when the
spirit of the Lord led me to a man who was
honest and intelligent; he was not a secta-
rlan, but had been endeavoring to show them
their error for twelve or fourteen years; he
believed the word of God, and declared to me,
that according to it, the seets must be wrong.
I advanced our faith to him, when he wanted
me to preach that night; he proffered his
house and to find a congregation, so I preach-
inged to them; he received it well, and promised
to see to these things. If he should come
into this church, he would be an ornament
in it.

From thence I traveled towards Franklin,
and on Thursday visited a Methodist preach-
ler and warned him faithfully; he soon be-
came silent. He told me of a Mormon that
was in the place, I called upon him, he re-
ceived me well, and wanted me to stop and
preach to the people. I staid with him three
days and preached twice, it made a good im-
pression. - Monday went to Franklin, from
thence through the woods in Warren county,
to this place. There are calls for preaching
here; brother G. Smith and myself, have an
appointment this evening, may the ord
bless us with his spirit.

Yesterday we visited a small branch of
Latter-Day Saints, about eight miles from
this place. We bore out testimony to them
in the name of the Lord, they received us
well, and wanted us to preach to them; we
promised to return. I believe they will come
out of the Old School. Brother Smith thinks
of staying a few weeks in this vicinity. We
preached on Monday the 19th, about ten miles
from Jamestown, had a good hearing; I be-
lieve there are some here who will obey the
gospel; may the Lord help them.

You may want to know how the Lord pros-
pers me in temporal things; I must say he
is very good to me. When I am hungry he"
feeds me, when I am thirsty, he gives me
drink, and when I am weary, he furnishes
me a bed to rest on, for which I feel to thank
and praise his excellent name. Pray for me."

We have before us a letter written by one
of the brethren who have gone West to set-
tle their business, and to preach the gospel,
directed to his family in this city, from which
we make the following extracts:
"Iowa, May 11, 1845."
DEAR COMPANION:
I take my pen this morning to let you know
that through the goodness of God our heav-
enly Father, I am in the enjoyment of good
health. * I arrived in Nauvoo, on the
evening of the 5th, and the first thing was,
have you come to stay? After my reply, they
answer was, you are a Rigdonite, you will
be whistled out of town. Perhaps you will
not understand the term whistling out of
town,' therefore 1 will explain it they have
a club in that city of corruption, which have
organized themselves, and are equipped with
dirks, pistols, and large knives to whittle
with; they take a club or cane of some kind,
and commence whittling on it, and whistling
after the person or persons they wish to get
rid of, and in this way to expell them out of
town. They whistled father Austin Cowles
out of the place, they run him to the river
again.
and got him in a skiff and sent him into the
Territory, and would not let him transact any
business; he had letters for some individuals
there, but could not deliver them.
On Wednesday morning, I was accosted
by one of them who asked me what my bu-
siness was in the city; I replied that I had
been absent from the place for nearly a year,
and I came to attend to my business; he told
me to leave the city, and that I could not
stay there. I told him that I was going to
attend to my business, I left in the afternoon
for Iowa. *
* * * *
I have only to say that my trust is in my
heavenly Father, and my prayer is that he
may give me his spirit to direct, with that
wisdom, knowledge, and faith, that will en-
able me to stand before them in the strength
of the mighty God of Jacob, that I may be
able to speak in that way that will strike
with terror their guilty consciences. Yes, I
ask your prayers, and the prayers of the
saints in my behalf, and in behalf of our
brethren, that God will deliver us out of the
hands of our enemies; for I must say, that I
believe our lives are at stake, if God would
permit them, for the wickedness of this peo-
ple, is truly greater than any one could im
agine. I have not language to express my
utter astonishment at the awful corruptions
which this people have entered into; for there
are some whom it seems God has given over
to work all manner of wickedness. I must
close, and I ask my heavenly Father to bless
thee, and give thee his spirit, and grant every
blessing thou needest, and hasten the day
when we shall be permitted to enjoy each
ether's society in peace.
Affectionately Yours."

Pittsburgh May 21st. 1845
BROTHER E. ROBINSON,
Sir:-I have within the last two
of three weeks learned from an authentic
source, that there is in Nauyoo-a report in cir-
culation that I have forsaken the church who
receive Elder Rigdon as the president of the
same, or to use my own language, and thus, con-
vey the true import of such a report, aposta-
tatized from the true order of the kingdom of
God, and inclined to stray after the twelve.-
Now sir this is without any foundation in truth
whatever, and here allow me to take the liber-
ty to say once for all, that I know to a certain-
ty that if there is any truth in the doctrine and
order of the church as set forth in the Bible,
of Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants;
have the friends of Elder Rigdon have the whole of
that truth.
If any person in Nauvoo or elsewhere, have
supposed that I ever was so far duped that I
could not see, hear, and, read for myself, I can
only say he was much mistaken in the person.
I trust that in a few days I shall be more
at leisure than at present when I shall avail
myself of the opportunity to write to you
again.
Yours as ever
B. WINCHESTER.
## The Mormons.
We regret that some of our brethren of the
press-we do not allude particularly to those
of our own city, are endevouring to cause ill
feeling against the Mormons on account of
the infamous wish of the editor of the Nauvoo
Neighbor, that "God, who never errs might
sprinkle, upon every man and city, who belies
to the saints, as upon Pittsburgh, now and then,
a hot drop!"
The great fire was, at worst, the result of
most culpable carelessness, but there is no-
thing to convince the most credulous bigot that
the Mormons set our city on fire. The fact is
that our Mormons are not of the church at
Nauvoo, but bitterly oppose it, why then
should they be held accountable for the con-
duct of one of those who denounce them.-
There is neither reason nor justice in such a
course.-Pittsburgh Spirit of the Age, May 26.
The Editor of the Age is entitled to our
thanks for his frankness in presenting this mat-
ter before the public in its true light.-Ed.
