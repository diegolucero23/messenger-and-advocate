# THE PLAN OF SALVATION.

BY S. RIGDON.

If any should think that we have not giv-en evidence sufficient on this subject, we have others against which no valid objection can be raised, we allude to the baptism of John the Baptist, John baptised multitudes, but not one spiritual gift followed his bap-tism; his disciples or those who were bap tised with his baptism, in the days of Paul, had no knowledge of the Holy Spirit. Now why was this so! the answer is easy, Johr had no order of government established, and as the spiritual gifts come after the order of government, no such things could follow John's baptism. The same may be said of John him self for it said of John, though his was more than a prophet, that he "performed no miracle" and if it is asked why! the answer is at hand; John had not establisned the order of the gov-ernment of heaven, and it was after that, and not before, that miracles came.

In pursuing the history of the Savior, there are some things that savor very much of the same idea. We have no account of there being miracles wrought among those whom he baptised, though it is said that he "bapti-sed more disciples than John," until he set his disciples in order, and then they went out and came back, saying, "the devils are sub-ject to us in thy name." These testimoni.als, we think, ought to put the subject, at rest in every candid mind.

Having then the facts of this subject before tis, we may inquire after the order of govern ment by which all the wonders of the church of Christ were preformed; for it is in vain to look for the powers of the spiritual king-dom any where but in the kingdom itself, which, to be the kingdom of heaven, must be organized according to the pattern: In order to do this, we must begin where we can begin, and with the revelations extant in our hands, we can and must begin with Moses; for it is in his writings where we have the first account given of this order. That the power of God attended the order of the things which Moses established, needs no proof from us; for all who read the scrip-tures, must be well acquainted with this fact, and also that the order established by Moses was of divine appointment, will not be doubt-ed by those acquainted with the bible. The question to be settled is, what was the order of things organized by Moses! This we will at-tempt to answer.

One thing is certain, that the first step in the organization, was to choose and inspire

Moses to set the house of God in order before God. The second step was to call and set a-part Aaron to be with and assist Moses, and the third step, to put this head of the organiza-tion in order, was to place Hurr with Moses and Aaron, and this done, this part of the or-der was completed. For the accounts of the union of Moses and Aaron, we direct the rea-der to the 4th chapter of Exodus from the 10th verse to the close of the chapter, where the account is given in detail. For the ac-count of Hur's connection with Moses and Aaron, see the 17th chapter of Exodus where all the attendant circumstances are related, as also the benefits which followed from this part of the organization. Had that quorum not have been organized, as God had directed Moses, there Israel would have been destroy-ed. So closely did the Lord adhere to the pattern he had given Moses; every iota of which, had to be observed in order for Israel' to have the power of God with them, but having the order full and complete, the pow. er of God was pledged for their deliverance. This quorum stood at the head of the organi-zation, and without which the rest of the or-der would have been unavailing, as the case with Amalek clearly shows.

Israel once having this head of their organ-ization completed, the power of God was exer-ted unto their deliverance, which would not have been the case had there not heen three persons thus united. Moses and Aaron alone could not have done it, but in order to have the power of God with them, so that their en-emies could not prevail, Hur must be united with them. Having this part of the pattern given to Moses completed, they could then complete the rest.

We are favored with another department of the organization in the 11th chapter of the hook of Numbers. Let the reader in order to see the entire subject, read the whole chap-ter. This part of the organization consisted of seventy persons, whom Moses knew to be el-ders of the people and officers over them. See the 16th verse "And the Lord said unto Mo-ses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thon knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congre-gation, that they may stand there with thee.' Moses was here commanded to take seventy men whom he knew to be elders of the peo-ple. Little doubt can remain they were of those mentioned in the 18th chapter of Exodus in whom Moses, at the instance of his father-in-law, had appointed rulers over the people, tu

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE,
## PITTSBURGH, PA.
When a subscriber in the country, wishes to send for the Messenger and Advocate, he can now take a sheet of cap or letter paper, write us a long communication on it, and inclose a bank bill and send it 300 miles for five cents-or any distance further for ten cents. As the price of our paper is very low. ourfriends must, in all cases, pay the postage on their letters. It will be but little for them, but it is very burthensome to us.

It would seem from communications received in various ways, that we are objects of envy in a peculiar manner: not only are the papers of the country, occasionally throwing out abuse, but there is a new system invented of sending us abusive letters, some are anonymous and others bear the signature of those who probably wrote them, or else there are those who are writing abusive letters over false signatures. We have recently received one of those productions with a signature to it that render it doubtful to us, whether or no, it is not written over a false signature, as we could not feel to charge the man, whose name is signed to it, with being sufficiently degraded to write such a production; for if we are to take it as an index to the author's heart, it must be degraded indeed, far beneath any thing we had supposed. It bears the signature of Charles Ivins, Keokuk, Iowa.

We cannot feel yet, to charge this very low and degraded production to his pen, and if he has not written it, we give him a chance to say so, and if he has we should really like to know it; for though Mr Ivins may not have had the advantages of refined society, we are not willing to lay to his charge, without the best evidence, a production that would disgrace any man, that was raised in a civilized community.

The letter was directed to Elder Josiah Ells of Allegheny city.

We are favored with letters, post marked at Nauvoo, of a similar character but generally, anonymous. All of which we have in reserve, as we shall probally at some future day give the history of that people, of which these letters will form a part. It is on this account, we give Mr Ivins the opportunity of taking the reproach off his character

if he is not guilty; for unless he is guilty, we do not wish to hand down to posterity his name appended to such a production.

As to the efforts making at Nauvoo; they are such as the authors are capable of making. Their manner of doing things, are surely peculiar to themselves. Paul said, long since of some people who should live in the last days, that they would "wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived," and if there are ever were or could be a people who answered that description, it is the people of Nauvoo. If they do not, none ever did or will.

The course they pursue is not only to deceive the world alone but one another.-

At one time the cry is "let the church of Christ alone let them die in peace" but before the sound thereof gets round, and back from whence it started, it is followed by another "they have ruined us, they have been the means of our Charters being taken; our lives and property are in danger." That is soon followed by the news "we are at peace, all is well and doing well." The next thing we hear are letters teeming with falsehoods issuing from their press, dated at Pittsburgh or some where else, said to be from a correspondent at the place where it bears date, but lo and behold on reading the communication, it is the production of one residing at Nauvoo who is well known for perjury, as his style always betrays him. Then finding that will not suceed they have recourse to an old stratagem, that of sending some of their tools abroad to invent and write falsehoods to them from such places as they may direst. A recent instance of the revival of this system has made its appearence; an ignorant booby by the name of Amos Fielding, is now employed in this service. The system was invented a long time since, and a docter Foster was the first agent in the employ of the author of this system of things. The Doctor started on his mission, with all the enthusiasm of his nature, and soon favoured the West with any quantity of letters of the above description; but what was the result? what might be expected? The Doctor, and his master soon quarrelled, and nothing but blood would satiate either party; the result was the master fell a victing to his own invention of desception, and then his followers made the Doctor leave without ceremony.

Such are the schemes, and such the results of a corrupted people. If this is not "deceiv-ing and being deceived", then no such things ever did, or ever will exist. No people but those whose "consciences are seared as with a hot iron" could be guilty of such folly and madness; but they have their reward, and ere long will receive it.

In the history of all the religions, and of all those who were followers of the religions revealed in the bible, there is nothing like the people of Nauvoo only among those whom the bible charges with having apostatised from the living God; the description of those whom the sacred writers call enemies to God so exactly suit the people of Nauvoo, that had that society existed in the days of the apostles, they could not have described them more perfectly than they have done; the de-scription is to the life.

There never were a people who served the living God, who could be driven to the a-buses and corruptions, to which the people of Nauvoo are driven, only apostatizing from God; nothing could do this, but want of confi-dence in God, which no people that serve God can lack; for they that serve God have the promise, "that they shall know of the doctrine whether it be true or false," so that a people that serve.God cannot lack confidence in him.

It is in all cases where men have recourse to false means to sustain themselves, they do it because they have not confidence in God; if they have confidence in God, they would trust the care and keeping of themselves into his hands in righteousness, come good or come evil. They would say as did Paul "I know him in whom I have believed, and I know he is able to keep whatsover I have trusted in his hands."

A people who fear God have none occasion to condescend to falshood nor wicked strata-gems, they take "the contradiction of sinners against themselves with patience, as seeing him who is invisible" without fear. The people of God, in these respects, have always been and will always remain, an astonish mind, at the same time, I can safely say that ment to the world. Through good report as I never tried harder, and was more devoted in well as evil their confidence was an anchor to my life, yet with all my tears and with all my the soul. Their characters, their life, and their prayers, 1 find I have erred in spirit and judge-all, they committed in to the hands of God as ment; and whilst in the midst of these into the hands of a faithful creator.

the Lord, and waited patiently on him until he sent deliverance, and if they had to die at the hands of their enemies, they bore it as from the hand of their God.

As to the people of Nauvoo or elsewhere if it is any satisfaction to them to rail at us, they can have all the benefit that will result from.it, either in time or eternity, knowing as of we do that ere long the Lord will judge be-tween us, and also knowing that we are in the hand of God, and not in theirs, and when they have gone far enough, the Lord will say "thus farshalt thon go and no farther," and there we will leave it.

Philadelphia,

August 20th 1845.

MY DEAR BROTHER:

I need not begin to tell you, (for language is inadequate,) how most heartily I do thank you for the very kind and affectionate letter which I received from you at the hands of Brother McLellin. It came very opportunely; for truly a friend is one who will give the warning voice to his friend when he sees him in danger, for I now realise that I was in danger, standing as it were upon a precipice; but whom shall I most thank? I feel to raise my heart to my heavenly Father, and say O Father, I will thank and praiso thee for all thy loving kindness; thou hast seen my ways and my wanderings from thee; thou hast shown thy servants the truth, the way, and the light, and that light has conie to me, and has reached the secret recesses of my heart more mightily than it ever did before.

I need not stop here to tell you the why's and wherefore's any more, concerning the sore trials and afflictions which Lhave had to pass in through since I saw you. Being well aware that I have brought many of them on myself, I do not feel to justify myself in the premises; yet at the same time when I reflect back it would appear as if circumstances were beyond my control. The many brethren that have passed through, and the different counsel res ceived from them, seented to bewilder my

DEAR BROTHER IN THE LORD:
I wish to give you
some information concerning the mission that'
was assigned Elder Brothers and myself at
the April Conference. We left Pittsburgh,
on July 3d, and arrived at Beaver in the after-
noon, went home with brother Greig, remain-
led with him that night. Brother Greig and
wife treated us with the utmost kindness; we
left them with the blessing of God, and pur-
sued on our journey. On the 4th we walked
or 14 miles, and arrived at the house of brother
Pry; gave out an appointment to preach the
same evening, we had quite an interesting
congregation, we preached the plan of salva-
tion to them, and I trust much good may result
from it. We continued our journey and pas-
sed on to Kirtland. We conversed with some
of the brethen in this place and vicinity, up-
on the all important subject of the organization
as of the church, and made known unto them the
apostacy that had taken place with the people
pass at Nauvoo; and some felt inclined to investi-
gate the subject presented. We contiuned on
and our journey to Cleveland, Ohio. On this rout
And we met with many things of interest; we saw

We passed on to the state of Michigan, took up our labors in Brownstown, Wayne co. In this place we found a branch of the church that stood connected with that body of people at Nauvoo; we appointed meetings and preached to them; our congregations were generally large and attentive. A portion of our time was devoted in examining the organization of the church, as it existed 15 years ago. proving that it was in accordance with the apostolic organization in the days of Christ; also proving that the twelve apostles, now so called, and the people at Nauvoo, have departed from the organization; and not only departed from the organization of the church, but have also taught many things that are calculated to destroy the happiness of mankind. We proved to them also, that Elder S. Rigdon is the legitimate president of the kingdom of God. The people all said that we had proved, according to our revelations, that if Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, then it followed, according to the revelations, that Elder Rigdon was also a prophet.

We baptized 6 in this region of country, and another gave in her name. Five of these were members of the branch at Brownstown. Places for preaching are open all through the country; the people are anxious to hear the truth. May God our heavenly Father, be pleased to send more laborers into this part of his vinyard, is our prayer.

We left Brownstown, and the saints were rejoicing in the truth, We preached in Franklin, Oakland co. some 6 or 7 times, and held one discussion with one of the Elders of that branch of the church. This branch also adhere to the twelve, but when the truth was preached, with regard to the apostacy that took place in Nauvoo, some of them expressed a determination to investigate the subject.-
The people in this place also said, that if J. Smith was a prophet, then Elder Rigdon must be one also. When we left this place, the people returned us their thanks for our labors, and many said, they believed we were men of God. I have no doubt but many will receive the truth in this vicinity. We preached in other places and the same results followed.-
The people want some more of our Elders sent to that State. The work of God is onward, and who can stop its progress? The answer is no one; but it will continue to spread among the nations of the earth until all things are consumated in righteousness. I have many things to say, which I trust will be edifying to the saints, but I must defer it until my next.

I would say in conclusion, to all the saints of God, let us keep the commands of our heavenly Father; let us practice the principles which we teach others; let us act in righteousness towards all men. We have many exampels before us where men have done that which is wrong; look at the people of Nauvoo, a people once in the favor of God; a people with'a prophet; a people who taught all the world that the church of Christ could not exist on the earth without a prophet at the head of it; and a people that have cried to the world, and "O your fathers garnished the tombs of the apostles, and you, their children, hold their memory sacred, and yet with all this, you do not want God, our kind Father, to send a prophet or an apostle into your midst; O how fallen is this generation," And truly it is so; but behold, O hark, and hear O ye nations of the earth, this same people that taught you so, many of them have fallen into the same dilemma; this same people have rejected a prophet of God; they have said they did not want one to be in their midst, O how can it be? I will tell you dear reader, it is because they have transgressed the law of God, they became exalted in their own minds, they departed from the truth, and thus they fell.-
When their prophet was murdered, they became like all former generations, they are ready to worship the the men that fell. But also they want no more living prophet in their midst; so they have said, and we do not feel to walk after them; they have fallen off from the true vine, hence they cannot receive any nourishment. Our prayer to God is that they may see the error of their ways, and turn therefrom. I would inform the saints that Elder Brothers intends to stay in Michigan, and he wants some help. Whe will go? The people wish you to come and preach. Let us be up and improving our tallents while the day lasts. May God bless you all, is my prayer.
