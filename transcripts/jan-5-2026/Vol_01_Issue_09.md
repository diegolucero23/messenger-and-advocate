The delay in the present No. of the paper has arisen fremt the determination to have ready for distribution at conference our new Hymn Book, which is now so far advanced that we feel warranted in saying it will le for sale, neatly bound in fine morocco at 374 cts. single copy, or $30 per hundred.

There is in the revelations of God to the children of men, a period pointed out in the history of Adam's race, designated as a day of righteousness-a reign of peare the Sabbath f the earth of a thousand years duration.

The fact is generally admitted, but the precise means by-which it is to be accomplished, is a subject of doubtful disputation, notwithstanding the prophetic testimony is as clear on he chain of precursory events, as it is with regard to the ultimate issue.

Our design at the present is to notice the important circumstance referred to by the prophets, that a special messenger is to be sent to prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man; one whose duty it is to set all things in order, and make ready for the reception of that august personage the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Be it remembered that Jesus of Nazareth is now coming as the lion of the tribe of Judah, to the salvation of Jacob his called, and Israel his chosen, to establish Zion, and to make Jerusalem the praise of the whole earth. No longer the despised Nazarine, but the Lord God Almighty, travelling in the greatness of his strength, to take vengeance on those who know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Isaiah, under the spirit of prophecy, breaks out in the following strain:

"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jeri salem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned; for he has received of the Lord's hands double for all her sios. The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked-shall be made straight, and the rough places plain; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."

# Malachi, in view of the same event, by constraint of the spirit exclaims:

"Behold I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap? And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years. And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts. For I am the Lord, I change not, therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed."

We are well aware that these prophecies have respect to the forerunner of the Son of God, in his advent of humiliation; but it must be abundantly obvious, that they have especial reference to that servant, who shall be commissioned to prepare the way for the glorious advent of Israel's King; accompanied with his saintly escort, to take formal possession of the kingdom, which shall extend from sea to sea, and from shore to shore,

To those who are not mere professors in their credence of the work of God of the last days, but really believe the word of the Lord received through Joseph Smith, we shall be able to show not only that such a servant has been sent, but to point out the very individual designated by God himself as such :-

"Behold, verily, verily I say unto my servant Sidney, I have looked upon thee and thy works. I have heard thy prayers and prepared thee for a greater work. Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do great things. Behold thou wast sent forth even as John, to prepare the way before me, and before Elijah which should come, and thou knew it not. Thou did baptize by water unto repentance, but they received not the Holy Ghost; but now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt baptize by water, and they shall receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even as the apostles of old."

It will be observed that the work of the forerunner of the last days, is markedly superior in its character to the mission of John

# the Baptist. He comes, it is true, in the humble capacity of a proclaimer of repentance and baptism. He is first sent to prepare the way before Elijah-having no power to confer the Holy Ghost. That work being accomplished, he is called to administer the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, even as the apostles of old; and the Lord declares positively that they to whom he administers shall receive it.

Having acquitted himself acceptably to God in these preliminary stages-he is called to hold the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and preside in council; and set in order all the affairs of this church and kingdom, during the term of his natural life; also to hold the keys of the school of the prophets. (Sect. 85.) In the same year he is called to be a spokesman to the then revelator of the church. (Sect. 95.)

In January, of the year 1841, the Lord promises to this same individual-Sidney Rigdon,.. And he shall lift up his voice again on the mountains, and be A SPOKESMAN BEFORE MY FACE." In April, of the same year, the Lord commands Joseph Smith to ordain him a prophet, seer, and revelator; which ordination was published to the world in the official organ of the church...

The crowning manifestation that God has considered him called and chosen and faithful, is found in the fact, that he has removed every man from the earth, whose authority could in any degree conflict with that of Sidney Rigdon. Above all in the fact that the Lord God has lifted the vail of futurity, and shown unto his servant the things that are coming on the earth; the wars, the distress, and the perplexity of nations-the order of the kingdom of heaven-the advent of Messiah-and the establishment of the rest of God on the earth.

This is not all, the Redeemer of Israel hath sealed these truths upon the hearts of his children, by the power of the Holy Ghost shed forth upon them, so that they can testify that they not only verily believe, but they know of a surety that the testimony which he brings is true, and that God hath sent him. The ordeal through which they have been called to pass, has been a fiery one; they have been called to withstand prophets and apostles; and to hold fast to the testimony of Jesus, in opposition to overwhelming numbers who professed to be saints. The mercy of God has

# [From the Boston Investigator.]
MORMONISM—THE “SPIRITUAL WIFE” DOCTRINE
Mr. Editor,—I return you my sincere thanks for your liberality in offering the use of your columns to any Mormon wishing to reply to any of my communications. In writing against the Mormons I feel no ill will personally towards any of them; neither do I fear their abuse. Let them honorably defend their doctrines; prove, also, if I have made any charges unsustained by evidence; if I have, I will “own up.” It is my firm, honest belief, that Mormonism is calculated to uphold the worst vices of our frail nature and as such is an incubus on society. My object is, to show it in its true colors; and in striving to do so, I shall strictly adhere to what I know to be true, and what can be sustained by a hundred witnesses.

The “spiritual wife” doctrine. I will explain it as taught me by Elder W——e as taught by Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Elder Adams, William Smith, and the rest of the quorum &c. &c. It is as follows:—Joseph had a revelation from God, that there were a number of spirits to be born into the world before their exaltation in the next; that Christ would not come until all these spirits received or entered their “tabernacle of clay;” that these spirits were hovering around the world and at the doors of bad houses, watching for a chance, however dishonorably, of getting into their tabernacle; that God had provided an honorable way for them to come forth—that was, by the “Elders of Israel” sealing up virtuous women, and as there was no provision made for woman in the scriptures, their only chance of heaven was to be “sealed up” to some Elder for time and eternity, and have a star in his crown forever; that those who were the cause of bringing forth these spirits would receive a reward—the ratio of which reward should be greater or less according to the number they were the means of bringing forth.

This, Mr. Editor, is the substance of the “Mysteries of the Kingdom” in as few words as I can use to explain it. That it is calculated, with a little sophistry, to delude the “faithful” weakminded, is self-evident. They reason thus. That God is no such a being as the scriptures would seem to represent, and the sectarian would believe; that fair woman was made for man, and those seeming wiser—the victim is held under bonds; fear jealousies of the Almighty, represented in the bible, were for the blinding of the Gentiles that they might not indulge their propensities or which God gave them, without his express permission. Thus, if a child steals an apple (for which he has a good appetite) he sins; but if the father gives him the apple, there is fair no sin in eating it. The members of the “spiritual” brotherhood and sisterhood are bound to keep it secret from the world and those of “little faith;” and if found out, to defend each other to the last. They are at liberty to use the grossest slander and falsehood to terrify into silence those who dare oppose them. They all solemnly disavow it in public; but the proof is now so palpable and self-evident, that they must father it. I as one, can solemnly prove before any court of justice, that the doctrine was taught and as for its being most scandalously and unblushingly practised in Boston, Lowell, New York, Philadelphia, and its outrageous doings in the “Holy City” of Nauvoo, I shall prove by unimpeachable witnesses. I challenge them to disprove it, if they can; and as I shall bring such a torrent of proof as will be a caution to the Euclidian of “this day and generation.”

Is this a doctrine to be countenanced by men whom human nature has left with one spark of honesty or common sense? Forbid it, Nature’s God! Whilst I have an arm to raise, a voice to speak, or a pen to write, I will not see my fellow beings swindled, deluded, brow-beat, slandered, abused, by villains under the mask of religion. Why, let me ask, has Parley P. Pratt, charged Elder Adams, in public print, of swindling saints, teaching false doctrines, “sealing people up” to eternal life? (“spiritually,”) &c. &c. Let the saints answer it. Why did Joseph give Elder Adams the “sealing for power,” even to preaching the spiritual wife doctrine publicly? Why did Elder Adams read his “commission” from Joseph in Suffolk Hall, Boston, giving him power and “keys” up above the Twelve? Answer that, and let Elder Adams answer for himself—no quibbling. Why did not the “first Presidency” call Elder Adams to trial and cut him off, as they have sealed and hundreds of others in like circumstances? Is who is not there something more than natural in this, if philosophy could find it out? Yet, which with all this evidence before their eyes, the saints will still uphold this spiritual-wife ignis fatuus. “Oh! shame, where is thy blush?”

The holy hypocrite is the most destructive of serpent that can assail the happiness of the few human family. Under the mantle of Church it is power he can work a greater mischief than all the villainy that parades society at large.—Like the mole, he winds his way unseen even to virtue’s fair citadel; and while you (having charity) think all secure, lays your fair fabric in ruins; but you are nothing the of the world’s exposure, and remorse of conscience, is half-stifled in the promise of a great reward, by the FALSE TEACHINGS of these per-unsanctified caitiffs in the sight of God, than her true and faithful or betrothed husband could give her. Woman! as you value your is fair fame, your peace of mind, and everything the that is dear to you, turn with horror and disgust from the outlines of a religion and the teachings and of men whose actions insult your ears to and understanding. Shun it and them as you

suchas are compelled to fellowship with them. Warsaw Signal.

The object of the meeting and of the exer-
tions of the two Saints who made themslves
conspicuous on the occasion, was to create
sympathy, for the poor -down-trodden, perse-
cuted Mormons, and if possible to save their
city charter.

They most positively denied the charges bro't
against the Saints, of stealing-declared that
the Mormons were the most heavenly and per-
fect people on earth, &c. &c.

During the evening, the proceedings of a
public meeting, held at Nauvoo, were read-
characterized by the most vindictive and bit-
ter feeling.

One of the resolutions of this meeting, was
very abusive of the Warsaw Signal, Alton
Telegraph and Quincy Whig:-it charged
those prints, with disseminating the principles
of mobocracy, and their columns had been,
and were occupied, by the "pens of murderers"
to "deafen the cry of innocent blood;" but we
have not the time and room to follow the pro-
ceeding through, and show their bitter malice,
and hatred of every thing saving Mormonism.

This people preach up their benevolence
and a great liberality towards mankind in gen-
eral. But after reading their resolutions de-
nunciatory of the presses, alluded to. what hope
would there be for the safety of these press-
es-the Alton Telegraph, Warsaw Signal,
and the Quincy Whig, were those wretches
to exercise unlimited sway. The assassin's

the order of the day. Where they had the

## FROM NAUYOO
A gentleman from Nauvoo, informs us, that
the great mass of the population of the city is
in a state bor dering on starvation. There is
no business going on, and no means of ob-
taining subsistance only by charitable dona-
tions from the richer classes. Subscriptions
are passing thro' the city for the relief of the
poor, & every day baskets are carried around
to collect provisions for the starving. Thefts
from the Rigdonites, are numerous as ever,

## RICH DECIDEDLY,
Our readers are all aware that the city of Nau-
voo is divided into two factions; the Rigdon-
ites and Twelveites-the latter being the
most numerous and far the greatest scound-
rels. The Twelveites in order to force the
Rigdonites into measures, commence a system
of pilfering, which became so oppressive that
some of the Rigdonites could no longer stand
their losses and either left the city or renoun-
ced their faith. Amongst the latter class, is
William Marks, who being a man of prop-
erty, sustained heavy losses by thefts, and on
account of the unsettled state of his business
could not leave the city. He, therefore pub-
lished a note a few weeks since in the Neigh-
bor, renouncing Rigdon-joining the twelve,
and exhorted all with whom he had any influ-
ance to do likewise. A few days after this, all
his stolen property was returned. His harness,
he says, was buried while absent. Now we
call this decidedly rich; but it is of the same
class of cases, with that reported by Mr. Kee-
gan, in another column, where a saint's cow
was stolen by mistake, and an equal amount
of beef and a hide returned upon finding it out,
with a note of apology, stating that the thief
thought it was gentile beef. Warsaw Signal.
[By what authority the editor intimates that
those persons in Nauvoo whom he calls Rig-
donites, are scoundrels we know not, and pre-
sume that he has none.]

Mormon paper atters some direful threat
against the democrats because the Legislature of Illinois repealed the Mormon city charter. He promises that the Mormons will alvote with the whigs in 1848, and defeat the democratic canidate for President. If Mr. Clay should be the next whig canidate, we may expect to see many interesting lett r pass herwen hi and his Mormo friends, and we would not be inuch surprised if-tomakeassurance dul sure some of the most arden of the whig leaders should become Mormon Prophets.

Parley P. Pratt prays that he may neve have the spirit of the saints at Pittsburgh (aposta es from the the plurality wife system.) Parley, you put me in mind of a very strong sectarian in New Hartford, N. Y. when he could not reply to Mormonisin, said to the saiat with whom he was conversing, well. "Mr. S. if lam wrong, I hope God will keep me wrong, and dam me for being wrong."-- Your prayer Mr. Pratt, may be answered.

CONFERENCE NOTICE
After due consideration, and taking a view of the situation of the various branches of the church east, west, north, and south, and the many letters-addressed to us from persons wishing to unite all their efforts with ours to push forward the cause in which we are engaged, and after seeking counsel from Him who never errs, we have come to the conclusion to appoint the general conference, in the city of Pittsburgh, to commence on the 6th of April next. As the 6th comes on Sunday, that day will be devoted to preaching and the business will commence on the 7th at which time we inteid that a full organ zation of the kingdom willntake place. The first Quorum of seventy is now nearly full. We have all the materials necessary to have a full and complete organization as set forth in our preced*ing number of this paper.

We hope that all the friends of the kingdom of God, will give attendance, as the occasion will doubtless be interesting as well as vastly important.

We would also inform our friends, that we have a choice selection of Hymn books now in press, which will be ready for delivery or the above occasiou.

### FATHER AND SON.

Sos. It would content me, father, first to hear How the Eternal frained the firinament; Which bodies ler d their influence by fire, Ard which are fill'd with Winter's hearty use; What sign is rainy, and what star is fair; Why by the rules of true proportion The year is still divided into months,

The months to days, the days to certain hours; What fruitful race shall fill the future world; Or for that time shall this round building stand;
Eawe
What lawgivers, what kings shall keep in Mens minds with bridle of the eternal law. FATHER. Wade not too far my boy, in waves too deep;
the fechle eyes of our aspiring thoughts Behold things present, and record them past, But things to come exceed our human reach And are not painted yet in angel's-eyes; power!
For these submit thy sense, and say-Thou that now art framing of the future world, nowest all to come not by the course of heaven,
By frail conjecture of interior signs, By monstrous floods, by flights and flocks of birds,
By bowels of a sacrificed beast, Or by the figures of some hidden art, But by a true and natural presage, Laving the ground and perfect architect Of all our actions now before thine-eyes, From Adam to the end of Adam's seed; O Heaven! protecting weakness with thy strength,
So. look on me, that I may view thy face, And see these secrets written in thy brow. () Sur! come dart thy rays upon my moon, That now mine eyes, eclipsed to the earth, May brightly be refi ed and shine to heaven; Transform me from this flesh that I may live Before my death regenerate with Thie. O thou great eat God! ravish mine earthly sprite That for all time a more than human skill May fill the faculties of all my sense; That when I think, thy thoughts may be my guide.
And when I speak I may be made by choice The perfect echo of thy heavenly voice."-- Thus say my son, and thou shalt know it all.
