# SERMON No. 3.
# DEDICATED TO THE SAINTS OF THE LAST DAYS.
BY 8. RIGDON.
Mark 10: 41-45. And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. But Jesus called them to him, and said unto them, yo know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for inany."

The doctrine of the church of Christ or the kingdom of heaven, as it is called in the scriptures, is of such a character as to demand of all who profess relationship to Christ the most serious consideration, for on it depends the present and final happiness of man, and without it there is no salvation, neither in this world nor in the world to come.

Christ, the head of his church and kingdom, came into the world not only to give himself a ransom for the people, but to teach the world of mankind the principles upon which the blessings flowing from his advent into the world, were to be enjoyed, and upon what to principle it was that man could inherit the salvation brought to light by the gospel. This, in his day, was a task of no ordinary labor.-/Men had their various schemes of salvation, to which they were wedded by the strongest ties of human nature; all supposing that their eternal interest was indentified with their religious theory, and their religions were so modified as to adapt itself to their views of worldly policy. Touch their religion and you touched their supposed worldly interest, The worldly policy of men, in all ages, did not only consist in gratifying their taste, and their appetite, in seeking and obtaining those desirable things that pertained to eating, and drinking, and the where with all to be clothed, but it extended to the relation they bore to others; they reached after honor amongst one another, to be called of one another Rabbi, Rabbi, to getting the uppermost seats at feasts, and the highest places in assemblies, with a train of other matters of about as much importance. - These, indeed/were the highest notions men Intertained of greatness. If these were noten-joyed they looked upon their religion of no avail, and useless. Every system to be of con sequence to them, must result in the obtaining of some or all of these desirable objects, and if these were not obtained it was considered of no consequence, and must be rejected as unprofitable.

After the first appearance of the church of Christ this same feeling began to shew itself among the earliest converts to the christian faith, and the very persons whom Christ had chosen to be his ministers to the world, soon began to manifest the same spirit that was then governing the whole world. No sooner were they chosen and set apart to the work of publishing the gospel to the world, than the next inquiry, in their minds, was to determine the degree of honor which they were to enjoy in their new calling. James and John takes occasion to express their desires, that they might have the most conspicious places, and be placed "one on the right hand and the other on the left in his glory;" this gave offence to the other disciples, and was the cause which called forth the words of our text. Jesus took occasion to correct their error, and set before them the true doctrine of his kingdom on these points, and the principles upon which his church was founded, and by which it would be built up in the world, as also the consequences which would follow a spirit such as was manifested and then manifesting itself among his disciples,

No one can read the Savior's teaching to his disciples without learning some important things in relation to man. The greater part of his teachings was devoted to the immediate benefit of the apostles, whom he had chosen, and by whom he was to teach the rest of mankind. To make them acquainted with the true principles of his kingdom, the spirit which should dwell in them, and the government of his church, employed him more directly and immediately; and particularly. Peter, James, and John, into whose hands the keys of the apostolic ministry was delivered; for though there were twelve apostles, the keys of that ministry was delivered into the hands of only three of them; they were not delivered into the hands of all the twelve, but to three only, and the others, though they held the same office, were made to a certain extent, dependent on the three, Into whose hands the keys of the ministry had been delivered. This will account for some things which are written in the New Testament. The defections of Peter, James, and John, are mentioned in the New Testament in destinction to others of the apostles, this is owing to the office they held in destinction from all other apostles, that of holding the keys of the ministry, and the of

# THE PLAN OF SALVATION.

BY S. RIGDON.

The plan of salvation. It has been consid-ered by the Deity that the salvation of man, was of sufficient importance to devise a plan for this purpose, called the plan of salvation. This plan is called the gospel, concerning which it is said, "that if any man preach any other gospel, let him be accursed." It is said of this scheme, that it was decreed in heaven before the foundation of the world, and that by virtue of it, God had predestinated to adopt children to himself; the result of which was, that the whole was to eventuate in the praise of his (God's) glory. By this scheme God would glorify himself, by redeeming man. These were the great objects to be obtained, and one which could not be obtained without the other. If God were glorified, men must be saved, and if men were saved, God would be glorified. The glory of God could be pro-moted only by saving man, and man could not be saved without promoting the glory of God.

To this end the Savior said, in his last pray er as recorded in the 17th chapter of John's gospel, "Father I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the work thou gavest me to do." What work was it the Father had given him to do? Paul says it was to make it possible for God to "be just and the justifier of them that believe." See Romans 3d chap-ter and 26th verse "To declare, I say at this time his righteousness: that he might be just and the justifier, of him which believed in Jesus." God could not be just and be the justifier of him that believed, had it not have been that Christ finished the work he gave him to do; but having finished that work, he could then say, "Father I have glorified thee on the earth," and then say "now O Father glorify thou me." All this depended on the accom-plishing of the work the Father gave him. Had he not have made it possible for the Fath-er to "he just and the justifier of them that believe," the Father could not be glorified, neither could he have glorified the Son. Hence the Savior said to his disciples, when they wondering, and ruminating, on his cruci-fixion, as recorded by Luke 24th chapter, 25th and 26th verses, "Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" In these sayings the Savior pre-dicates his own glory on his having suffered what he did suffer. According to what the Savior says, if he had not suffered he would not have entered into his glory; for his own glory depended on his finishing the work the Father gave him to do, and having done that, he laid a foundation to save man, and through that means glorified both himself and the Father.

The conclusion which forces itself on the mind, from the above, is that unless the believ-ers in Christ are justified and saved, neither the Father or the Son will be glorified. So nearly is the salvation of man related with the glory of the Deity, that one cannot exist with-out the other. If the Deity is glorified, man must be saved, and if man is saved, the Deity is glorified.

The Savior in his last prayer introduces into the above connection, in the following words, his disciplus, see John's gospel 17: 18, "As thou has sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world." By this we see what place the disciples were to supply in the plan of salvation. Christ sent them into the world as the Father had sent him into the world. If so then, they had a place to supply in relation to the salvation of man, and Christ sent them into the world, in order that the plan of salvation might accomplish the object for which-it-was-instituted; and might eventuate in glorifying the Father and the Son, by glorifying man. In the 22d verse the Sa vior says thus, "And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one." Here it is said that the glory which the Father had given the Son, the Son had given his disciples.

Put all the above sayings together, and they amount to this, that the Father glorifies the Son, and the Son glorifies man, and man and the Son glorifies the Father; and no one of them is, or can be glorified without the other. Hence says Jesus, in the 15th chapter of John's gospel 7th and 8th verses, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and and it shall be done un-to you. Herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples." By this the Father is glorified when the disci ples bring forth much fruit. So Immediately does the scriptures identify that thing which they call glory, of the heavens and the earth, that one cannot exist without the other.

For this cause, was a dispensation of the gospel committed unto man, that through their effort in spreading the gospel, the fruit thereof might abound and the Father and the Son both be glorified, and man be sharers in the glory; that they all might be one in effort, enterprise, in suffering, and in the final triumph of truth, and in the glory which should follow equal sharers, according to their several abilities. We might say a few things about glory. Glory is the result of enterprise and final tri-umph. When we view a man as having thrown a hallow of glery around him, it is be-cause of his brilliant achievements, his sacra fices, and his unceasing efforts, untill he ob tains the end he has in view; and if the end when obtained, results in the benefit of man, we say of him that he has won imperishable honors and glory which cannot fade away. The enterprise in this case is a brilliant one. It is no less than to redeem the world from under the dominion of Satan. Satan has

## PRESIDENT RIGDON:

Yours of the 16th inst. arrived
affair as to publish it in their Messenger and
send it to the four winds. When I arrived 1
visited my brethren and endeavored to show
to them, in the spirit of meekness, that they
were not acting according to their best inter-
ests. They believed me, and on last evening
we had an appointment for the church to come
together; they came, and with but little dif-
ficulty we buried the hatchet so deep that we
lost sight of the end of the handle. Fellow-
ship and peace are restored to the saints
here. And in all my past experience in the
settlement of church difficulties, I really
think that I never saw a better state of feeling
than on this occasion.. Our enemies may
cease their unhallowed joy, but our brethren
may now all lift up their heads and rejoice in
consequence of the peace and unity which ex-
lists among the lovers of truth and order in
this great city; where the fires of freedom
once burned in the hearts of the patriots of
the revolution..

I have only preached five times since my
arrival here. Considerable interest begins to
be manifest among those who have attended.
We have another meeting this evening at our
Hall which begins to be crowded with listen-
ers. I expect to baptize a number this week.
Several applications have already been made.

in unity, and now we have no fears of her

Elder Soby. Knowing that some of my fam-
ily had been_unwell, my anxieties by this
time had become intense to hear from them.
Your kind letter quelled all my feelings on
their account to hear that they were well, and
rejoiced my heart greatly to hear of the par-
ticular prosperity of our common cause. To
learn that the church in Pittsburgh is still
steadily adding to their numbers, and that
they are increasing in faith, and growing in
fellowship and love for each other strengthens
my heart to go forward and act well my part
in the great work, lest I (by any means) fall
out by the way and "another take my crown"
I feel not the least discouraged. I realize the
work before us is great, very great indeed-
and that it will require all our energies to be
brought into requisition to perform well our
parts, that each man may at the final triumph
of the kingdom hear the Messiah pronounce
to him "well done thou good and faithful ser-
vant, thou hast been faithful over a few things
I will make thee ruler over many things, en-
ter thou into the joy of thy Lord". 1 can

all my life to go forward in righteousness, that

BROTHER RIGDON:
York, July 28, 1845.
Dear Sir:-It affords me
pleasure to inform you that I have duly re-
ceived all the numbers of the Messenger and
Advocate. I consider it a very valuable pa-
per, giving in the course of a year a vast a-
mount of information for the simple sum of
one dollar. I would advise all persons who
wish to obtain a correct knowledge of the true
situation of the religious world, and of the na-
ture of prophecy, particularly that which re-
mains to be fulfilled, and also of the true.
church of Christ in these last days, to subscribe
for it by all means. I am confident that all
those who do, will never regret it.
Never did I peruse any thing that gave me
so much gratification as I realized whilst
reading the minutes of your conference when
the kingdom of Daniel was organized. The
work was a great one and I am satisfied it never
could have been accomplished with so much
unanimity and fraternal love as was manifest-
ed on that momentous occasion, unless God
w was with you in a special and powerful man-
net. I rejoice that the work of God is being
carried out. I also rejoice and thank God
that the pure and unadulterated doctrines of
the Savior of the world, are again proclaimed
to the world in their original beauty and sim-
plicity. It is my earnest and devout wish
that this kingdom may roll-on until the frag-
ments of the fourth beast (the Roman Empire)
be completely swallowed up in it, and it be-
comes the kingdom of our Lord and his
Christ.
Having said thus much in refference to pa----
per and the kingdom of Daniel, permit me Sir
