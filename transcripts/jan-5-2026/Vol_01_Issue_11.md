# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE,
OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST.

A SERMON DEDICATED TO THE
SAINTS OF THE LAST DAYS,
BY S. RIGDON.

"Let no man break the laws of the land, for
he that keepeth the laws of God, hath no need to
break the laws of the land: wherefore be subject
to the powers that be, until He reigns whose
right it is to reign, and subdues all enemies un-
der his feet."-Book of Cov. §18, 15.

The above text, which is taken from the
book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church
demand the strictest attention of all who pro-
fess to be members of the church of Christ.
They were written particularly for their use
and benefit, and in every respect suited to
their present and future condition, be that as
it may. It is said in the book of Mormon,
that the Lord had this goverment established
for the purpose of building his church under
its protection, or words to this effect; clearly
intimating that the laws, and institutions of
the government were every way suited to
the end for which they were intended.
If our text has any meaning at all, it es-
tablishes one fact, beyond controversy, that
such are the laws of this land: that in order
to obtain salvation, it is not necessary to break
them, that they are of a character that every
duty can be performed and requirement com.
plied with, that is in any way connected with
our salvation, without violating in any de-
gree or trampling on the political institutions
of the country.

When the Lord says that he organized or
caused political institutions to be organized
for a particular purpose, we have all confi-
dence that they were every way calculated
to obtain the end for which they were in-
stituted, and when, by after revelation, he
says to those, for whose benefit he said he
had caused them to be established, and after
the church had been organized by special di-
rection from himself, that in order to keep
his commandments, they (the church) need
not break the laws of the land, we feel our-
selves at liberty to believe, that there is nothing
pertaining to the salvation of that church or
people, which renders it necessary for them to
violate the laws of the land, and that every vio-
lation of the laws of the land, is uncalled for
In this case the language is very expressive,
that those who keep his commandments, need
not break the laws of the land. He does not
say that those who profess to keep his com-
mandments, will not break the laws of the
land; he only says they need not do it. The
same as to say that there is nothing in his com-
mandments that bring men into collision with
the laws of the land, and if they do violate
them it is not by virtue of his commands that
they do so; for as far as keeping his command-
ments are concerned, they would not have
driven them to such a necessity.
It is worthy of remark that the sayings in
the Book of Mormon, were written before the
church was organized. Thus authorizing the
people who believed the book to believe that if
on the belief of that book, and according to the
things contained in it, they should be organized
into a church, they could do it in a country, and
among a people, where the Lord had previous-
ly prepared a code of laws suited to the up-
building of the cause in which they were en-
gaged. Query, was this a false expectation
or was it not? Or did the Lord, in causing
the laws to be framed, do it for the purpose of
using those who believed the Book of Mor-
mon to be persecuted? And those persecu-
tions to be brought on by reason of the com-
mandments of the Lord compelling those who
obeyed them to break the laws? To obtain
this object the Lord need not have given him-
self much trouble, to have had a special go-
vernment formed for this purpose, any govern-
ment would have answered his purpose. But
to suppose this would only be to insult the
Deity.

When the Lord said that he had given free-
dom to this nation, and caused the government
to be organized so as to make it a place suited
for building his church, he could have but one
meaning, and that was, that in this land he
could build his church, without being brought
into contact with the municipal laws of the
country; and this view of the subject is put
for ever at rest by the words of our text. We
are here told that the commandments of the
Lord do not come in contact with the laws of
the land, and no man who keeps them need
break the laws. From the above view of the
subject, we learn firstly, that every command-
ment which renders it necessary to break the
laws of the land in order to keep it, is not of
God, or it was not given for salvation. And,
secondly, that those who obey such command-
ments, are not promoting the things of sal-
vation.

No fact we think can be plainer to those
who believe in the Book of Mormon, and the
Book of Doctrine and Covenants of the Church,
than the first position we have taken. Should
it be admitted that the laws of this country.
where the Lord has cast our lot, and where he
has commanded us to build his church, were
in opposition to the the laws of God, so as to sub-
ject those who keep the laws of heaven to
punishment, we should like to know why it
was that the Lord said he had caused this go-

vernment to be established for the express purpose of having his church built up in it, or under its protection? What is the use of government? The answer is, to protect the rights and interests of those who are its subjects. Take this conservative principle from governments, and they are curses instead of blessings to any people. The only object a had God could have in establishing a government for the benefit of any people, was that the people, for whose sake it was organized, might be protected by its laws and institutions. In this case it was said to be done for the purpose of establishing the laws of heaven in it, and for the building up of the church of Christ in it. Now we ask why establish a government for the this purpose? No man can answer otherwise, than that those who belonged to that church, when built, might be protected by its laws and political institutions; for no other object fall, but this could be, that was worthy of God. yea, we might say of men; but should it so happen, that in the course of events, the Lord should deliver commandments which were in opposition to the laws of this land, and thereby to make the government punish those who obeyed them, of what avail would the government be? None, only to be an engine to inflict punishment on those who obeyed the requirements of heaven; and pray what use was a government of this description to those whom the Lord had separated to himself? All must answer, none; but a great evil—a great curse. Are we, then, to understand the Lord as saying that he caused liberty to be established on this land, that his church might be cursed in it, and the blood of his saints shed? no man in his senses will or dare say it. What then; why; if the Lord did do as the Book of Mormon says he did, he certainly never intended to give commandments in opposition to the political institutions which he had caused to be established. If it should be otherwise, we must charge the great Jehovah with a duplicity and baseness that would make the baser sort of men blush.

We ask the reader to notice, particularly, that the Lord is said to have caused this government to be formed, long before his church was in existence, for the purpose of building his church in it, in his own due time. Had of not the Lord power enough, and wisdom sufficient, having before him, at the same time, given the entire platform of his church, being the author of both himself, to adapt the one to the other, so that the laws and institutions of the two need not come into collision? Who will answer he had not? We presume none. Then if the platform of this government was such as that not to admit of the introduction of all the laws in of the kingdom of heaven and not be in contact with them who is to blame? The Lord declares he was the author of both; either, then, may he lacked ability or else will to do so, and in either case a man must have a sorry opinion of his God.

But our text comes happily to our relief, and declares that no man need break the laws of the land, in order to obey the religious institutions of heaven, the same as to say that the political and religious institutions of heaven were not in opposition to each other, and he who obeyed the religious institutions of heaven had as good a right to the protection of the political institutions, as those who obeyed the political institutions only. But let us suppose for a moment, that the Lord does give a commandment that is in violation of the laws of the land, and cannot be kept without breaking them, and what then becomes of our text? In that case need a man break for the laws of the land in order to keep the laws rise, of God? Judge ye, and what become of the arch, truth of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, laws, and of the Book of Mormon, and when they subject fall, what becomes of the church?—all perish God, together.

Hence we conclude, and we think justly too, that any commandment or revelation that in comes in the last days, which is in opposition to the laws of this land is not of God, for God cannot contradict himself, or else he ceases to be God, or else it is not given for salvation. But some may say the Lord gives revelation to be only for a limited time, and then they are superceded by others. However true this may be in other cases, it cannot be in this; for the difficulty in the Book of Mormon gets into our way, that the Lord organized this government, or caused it to be done, for the purpose of building his church in it, and should he ever at any time give revelations commanding his people to do things which are in opposition to the laws of this land, he would impeach his own character.

View it in what point of light we can, and it amounts to the same thing, that as soon as there comes a commandment from the Lord, which is in opposition to the laws of the land, there is an end to both the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants; and as long as we believe these to be of God, so coming, it matters not who from prophet, church apostle, revelator, or seer, that cannot be kept without breaking the laws of this land, is not Had of God, unless it is given in wrath, and intended to be a curse to those to whom it is given.

Our second position, we think, is not less the manifest: That those who obey such commandments or commandments, do not promote the things of salvation by so doing.

It will not admit of controversy to suppose that any revelation which is not of God does in any degree promote the salvation of any. In relation to revelations in general, as given in the different ages of the world, a few words then, may not be amiss. There are things said on in this subject which is of importance for all to know, who believe in prophets and revelators In these last days.

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

PITTSBURGH, PA. MARCH, 15, 1815.

Postmasters are authorized by law, to frank letters for a third person, containing money, when addressed to an Editor or a publisher of a newspaper.

Will our friends and agents remember this.

"We have to announce that Sidney Rigdon has been ordained a Prophet, Seer and Revelator."—*Times and Seasons Page 431.*

"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned." Matt. 12: 37.

On the 8th of August, 1844, at a special meeting of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, convened at the stand in the city of Nauvoo, PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG asked the saints what they wanted. Do you want a guardian, a PROPHET, a spokesman or what do you want? If you want any of these officers, signify it by raising the right hand. NOT A HAND WAS RAISED.—*Times and Seasons, page 637.*

"You are now without a prophet present with you in the flesh to guide you."—*Brigham Young's Apostolic Epistle, Times and Seasons, Page 618.*

Our conference is over. The meeting of kindred spirits, congregated by the same impulse, from almost every part of the United States; many of whom had never beheld each other in the flesh—yet influenced by the same Spirit—inspired with the same indomitable devotion to the cause of God; filled with the same holy zeal, to stand forth in defence of bleeding Zion and vindicate her cause—the cause of truth and righteousness—these feelings pervading every breast, as we have every reason to believe they did, to a man; what meeting could approach nearer the communion of the departed just? Who, that was priviledged to participate in that commingling of congenial spirits, in the social circle, at the family alter, in the solemn assembly, and unite in the sacred obligations, consecrations, and dedications; above all who that felt the holy unetion which bore record of the Father and the Son, and made them realize that God was there; that they were sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus—who, that was at that conference will ever forget it; in time or eternity? Not one.

We feel, if we are not one ourselves, we are associated with the noble men of the earth; men in whose breasts, those exalted and heavenly principles which dwell in the bosom of God—find a place. We hail them as Gods elect messengers of salvation to the human family; called and chosen, one thing yet remains to secure to themselves a crown of righteousness which fadeth not away—to be faithful. We do not for a moment doubt that they will cherish, treasure up and exhibit in their lives, those pure and holy instructions delivered by the Spirit of truth through our beloved President; we know verily by the testimony of the same Spirit, if they do, they shall stand as among the things that CANNOT be shaken and must remain.

We will not attempt to describe the feeling of admiration which was produced in our heart, in looking upon that band of brothers, as they met and pledged themselves in the presence of God, angels and each other, to vindicate the cause of virtue and holiness, to stand by each other “as a terror to evil doers, and the praise of them that do well.” If we had cherished one lingering doubt in our breasts as to whether those men were the servants of the living God, in deed and in truth; it must have vanished for ever. The ready alacrity to make every sacrifice which might be required, to secure the triumph of truth and righteousness, and restore peace and joy to the whole earth—the intense interest manifested, to preserve inviolate the sacred principles of eternal salvation—the heavenly heroism which esteemed all things but as dross, compared with the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord—would have led any honest man to exclaim, this people is my people and their God is my God. This in fact was the precise condition of some individuals who came only as spectators, and with no very favorable feelings; who were led to humble themselves before the Lord in the waters of baptism, and pour forth their fervent ejaculations of gratitude, that God had brought them there.

What shall we say more? The kingdom of our God is established in righteousness. The King has sealed his acceptance of the organization by the outpouring of his Spirit; by vision, and revelation., Who, then can determine the eternal consequences which shall flow from that unobtrusive assembly? Compared with the kingdoms of this world as a grain of mustard seed. The least of all Kingdoms!

ye should shew forth the praises of him who Jacob C Jenks
hath called you out of darkness into marvel-

In the afternoon the saints met to partake of

Cole and George W. Robinson, clerks. The
President arose and read the first Hymn in his
own new collection of Hymns and after it was
sung by the congregation, he kneeled before
God with the conference and addressed him in
solemnity, in tears and in strong and fer-
vent supplication, and dedicated himself and
the conference to Almighty God. Then all
that had been ordained under his hands to be
prophets, priests and kings unto God, were re-
quested to come forward and take the front

The president then observed that if any of
the quorum should die or transgress so as to be
cut off, that the place or places should be filled
by others. He then gave a solemn warn-
ing to all to take heed "that no man take thy
crown."
God requires that you should, now and hence
forth, act in your authority and bear off trium-
phantly the church and kingdom of God..
Here is the begining-you must triumph until
you meet the Son of God on Mount Olivet.-

shall be the kings over whom the Son of God
shall reign as King of kings and Lord of
lords. I lay it upon you to be crowned in the
presence of God when Jesus shall come with
all the hosts of heaven; when heaven and earth
and shall be redeemed.
Elder Sidney Rigdon then said the quorum
was now full-was organized agreeably to the
re-pattern of heaven, and he had now so far done

The grand council of Seventy-three was now desolved, and the different Quorums of the church called out and formed in order, beginning with the Twelve.

The president then proceeded to give a charge to the respective Quorums.

# To the Quorum of the Twelve.

The Twelve are a travelling presiding High Council. They can never set as a Quorum except seven of their number are present.-

Out of respect, the oldest man in their council, should set to preside in the deliberations of their own body. In conferences, they are to preside alternate, from the eldest to the youngest. They should keep a record of all their proceedings. They are a court, having appellant jurisdiction in all cases relating to the churches abroad. Appeals can be made to you from Evangelists court, and also, Elders' court in the churches abroad, if circumstances will admit you are required to hear also, all appeals from the Seventies' Quorum, whether at home or abroad. There is no appeal from the decision of your Quorum except to the Grand council, and that subject to the rules governing that council. In appeals from your Quorum, the papers must be sent to the first presidency, who have the right to determine whether the appeal shall be heard or not.

Stand, brethren, before God, so that you can commune with him. This is the most important thing I have to say to you. It is the perogative of this Quorum only, as a Quorum, in the absence of the first presidency, to consecrate to God, those of the Grand council. who are now absent. I lay this upon this Quorum. No Quorum in the church, has a right to rule over this Quorum, except the first presidency. You are also, subject to the decisions of the Grand council, of which you form a part.

Go, Brethren, and teach not only the gospel, but the rules of propriety in the family circle, and in the walks of life, in all righteousness, and lowliness of heart. I give to you this charge in the presence of God and these elect messengers, whom God has chosen, or elected for the salvation of the world. For God's election of angels or messengers is for the salvation of man.

When you want assistance, call upon the presidents of the Seventies, or High Priests, or Elders' Quorum. You can also, call on the Bishop for Priests or Teachers if necessary. You are to see that the gospel is preached to all the world, for a testimony to all, that the end may come.

When you ordain young men, ordain them to be Elders, and notify the Presidents of the Seventies, that they may place them in their Quorums, to be under their tuition. When you ordain middle aged or aged men, to be Elders, you will notify the presidents of the of Elders' Quorum, that they may be received into that Quorum, to be under their tuition, except they wish to enter into the Seventies' Quorum, in that case, you will notify the presidents of the Seventies. When you ordain High Priests, you must notify the presidents of that Quorum, that they may be received under their tuition. When you ordain Priests, let them be middle aged, or aged, but not young
