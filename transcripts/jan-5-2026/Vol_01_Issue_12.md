# MINUTES
Of a Conference of the Church of Christ, held in
the City of Pittsburgh. commencing on the 6th
and ending on the 11th of April, A. D. 1845.
CONTINUED.
Wednesday Morning, 9 o'clock, April 9.
Conference met agreeable to adjournment,
and was called to order by Austin Cowles,
president of the High Priests Quorum, the
first presidency not being present, the morn-
ing was spent in singing, prayer and exhor-
tation, until the usual hour of adjournment.
Conference then adjourned until 2 o'clock.
Wednesday Afternoon 2 o'clock,
Conference met pursuant to adjournment,
and was called to order by Austin Cowles;
the first presidency, and the high Quorumen-
tered and took their seats. President Rigdon
arose and read Hymn on page 104 "Aimse, a-
rise, with joy survey," which was sung by
the conferenee.
After which, President Rigdon said, since
the commencement of this conference I have
had one unceasing desire, deep, and intense,
that was, to have the matter forever put at:
rest, whether God would accept our work.
The Spirit whispered me this morning to set
apart some brethren, and consecrate them to
God, in a room in my own house, which I did;
(which was the reason I was not with you this
morning,) and after the washing and anoint-
ing, and the Patriarchal seal, as the Lord had
directed me, we kneeled, and in solemn pray-
er we asked God to accept the work we had
done; during the time of prayer there appeared
lover our heads, in the room, a ray of light for-
ming a hollow square, inside of which, stood
a company of heavenly messengers, each with
a banner in his hand, with their eyes looking
downward upon us, their countenances expres-
sive of the deep interest they felt in what was
then passing on the earth; there also appeared
heavenly messengers on horseback-with
crowns upon their heads, and plumes floating
in the air, dressed in glorious attire until, like
Elisha, we cried in our hearts, "the chariots
of Israel, and the horsemen thereof; "even my
little son of fourteen years of age saw the Vis
ion, and gazed with great astonishment, say-
ing, that he thought his imagination was run-
ning away with him, after which we arose
and lifted our hands to heaven in holy convo-
cation to God, at which time, it was shown
an angel in heaven registering the acceptance
of our work, and the decree of the Great God,
that the kingdom is ours, and we shall prevail;
my anxieties therefore, in relation to our work
in organizing the kingdom, and the accept-
ance of that organization, by our heavenly
Father, is now forever at rest.
Elder Wm. E. McLellin, then arose and
bore testimony to the manifestation of the
power of God in the heavenly vision; he then
gave the substance of a revelation given this
morning, relative to the opening ceremony of

From all the above quotations, we can arrive
at some degree of certainty, what it was the
Savior meant, when he said John was more
than a prophet. His mission was peculiar to
himself; he was not only a prophet, but he
was sent on a mission that no other prophet
ever had, a restorer unto Israel, to turn the
hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the
hearts of the children unto the fathers, and pre-
pare their way before them; that the kingdom
of heaven might come unto them, through
which the resurrection of the dead would
eventually come. Hence, " of all that was
born of women there was not a greater than
John." He had the understanding to do what
none else could do; and had the Jews re-
ceived it, he would have done it, and instead of
Israel being scattered and cursed, they would
have triumphed over their enemies, and through
them would have come the resurrection of the
dead, and all the glory promised to the world.
'They would have obtained the rest of God,
and enjoyed its power. This was the object
of John's mission to them; but because they
rejected him he died without doing it, and left
them to be cursed. There is one thing we
wish the reader particularly to notice in rela-
tion to John's mission, that he was not said to
be the messenger to go'before the Lord's face,
and prepare the way before him; but the Lord's
messenger to go before the face of the Jews and
prepare their way before them. Behold I
send my messenger before thy face which shall
prepare thy way before thee. The correspond-
ing account in both Mark and Luke are the
same. See Mark 1st chapter, 2d verse, and
Juke 7th chapter, 37th verse. Let so much
suffice for the mission of John.

# The Consecration

He ther arose, and said, brethren, I wish to say some things to you which will benefit you on the present occasion, he set forth in a clear manner, the principles which constitute the fulness of human happiness, giving much important instruction in relation to it,

President Rigdon then proceeded to ordain Hiram Falk and Curtis Hodges to the office of High Priests. After which several bottles of oil were presented and consecrated to the Lord.

The quorums then proceeded to the holy consecration by washing and anointing. Elder J. M. Cole, washed the quorum of the Twelve, and President E. Robinson the Presidents of the High priests quorum, who were anointed by President S. Rigdon. The washing and anointing continued to the hour of adjournment, when conference adjourned by singing and prayer, till to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.

Thursday, April 10, 9 o'clock, A. M.
Conference met pursuant to adjourment, and was called to order by president Austin Cowles, after which the first presidency and high quorum entered, when the conference was opened by singing an hymn.

The president then addressed the conference on the subject of covenants, setting forth upon what principle it was the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, showing that this power belongs to the kingdom of God alone, and also, the necessity of having the kingdom of heaven organised in addition to the church, in order that this covenant of binding the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers might be entered into, before God, that the way of the coming of the Savior might be prepared, and that the whole earth might not be smitten with a curse when he comes. And also, upon the Priesthood which pertains to the kingdom of God, shewing its relation to the heavens and also, to the earth, setting forth the power of that priesthood in relation to the salvation of the fathers who have died before, and of the children who should come after; and without that priesthood, no person who now lives, or who have lived before, or who shall live here-after, could be saved.

He spoke of the baptism for the dead showing that it was of no avail, unless the persons being baptized for the dead, should maintain their integrity and power before God, until they obtained the priesthood of the kingdom, and through that priesthood bare off the kingdom triumphant, and through these means present themselves before God, triumphant, with their dead with them. And unless they did that they would be cut off, and perish, and in their dead with them.

Elder Joseph M. Cole then kneeled and dedicated the Conference by prayer, during which




and prayer, at a fixed period, the right hand of leach member of the Conference, was lifted to heaver, and a solemn covenant, by which we bound ourselves and families to God, was pronounced, which was sealed by a loud amen, by every individual. After which an hymn was sung, and the Conference proceeded to the washing and anointing of the rest of the quorums.

President Rigdon then proceeded to ordain Austin Cowles, president of the high priest quorum, to preside over the councils of the whole church, in the absence of the first presidency; and to be the first president unto the church, in his absence.

The president then ordained Solomon Rum-field an elder in the church.

The hour of adjournment having arrived, and the washing and anointing not yet completed, after a fe w remarks by president Rigdon, the conference adjourned to 2 o'clock this afternoon. Benediction by Austin Cowles.

2 o'clok, P. М.
Conference met pursuant to adjourment, and opened by singing, and prayer by president S. James.

The washing and anointing was continued, until all the official members present were anointed. After having finished the anointing, president Rigdon read a hymn which was sung; after which all the quorums took their seats in proper order, to receive their Patriarchal seal. The Patriarch then proceeded to place his Seal upon their heads, sealing upon them all the promises and prophesyings pronounced upon them, during their washing and anointing, commencing with the quorum of the Twelve; next in order came the presidents of the Stake at Pittsburgh, and the High Council. After, these quorums had received their Patriarchal Seal, the Conferènce adjourned until to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock. Benediction by President S. Rigdon.

This was the afternoon of the great fire which desolated our city. While we were thus organizing the Kingdom of our God, and consecrating the officers thereof, to the Most High, our city was fast laying in ruins by the violence of fire; and our friends and neighbors in the midst of sorrow, distress and confusion, were flying for their lives, amidst the ragings of the devouring elements, to places of safety, and leaving their all to perish in the common rain. In the closing prayer, for the adjournment, president Rigdon presented before the Lord the deep distress and great calamity which was then befalling the inhabitants of the city; presenting before the heavens the widow and the fatherless, and the sufferings and deep afflictions that were overwhelming our city; praying God to atay the violence of fire, that our whole city be not laid in ruins-in which prayer the Conference joined with all the feelings of their soul. During this prayer, an escort of heavenly messengers that had hovered around us during the time of this

DEAR BROTHER:
As I have not had the pleasure of hearing
from you since July last only through the
medium of news paper letters, which I have
read, and which, by the way, I like very
much; I write to you at this time in hopes of get-
ing an answer, as you have been always so
kind as to answer my letters heretofore.
I will now speak a little concerning relig
ious matters, as it is a subject of interest to both
of us, and you would no doubt like to hear
how we stand in this section of country..
New Bedford, being a little off the route of
extensive public travel, has not till lately,
been at all agitated with the subject of Rig-
dontsm as it is called, there having been no
one here to set before the people the claims of
Elder Rigdon to the first Presidency of the
Church; for that reason the saints had heard
nothing of the matter, except through the me-

Yours in the bonds of the Gospel,
RICHARD SAVARY, Esq. C. A. ROGERS.
through Joseph Smith, I must object the
Twelve, as heads of the chureh, and uphold
Elder Rigdon in his legal office of Prophet,
Seer, and Revelator. I made known to some
of the brethren the conclusions I had come to,
and they sent to Boston for the presiding high
priest of this District to come on, which he
hastened to do as soon as possible, to look out
for wolves in sheep's clothing; but instead of
stripping off the sheep skin, and showing
the wolf naked, plain, ferocious, and un-
tamed, to the sheep of this fold, he, by his
own acts, convinced those who were honeste-
nough to be willing to stand by truth, through
evil as well as good report, that his cause was
a lame one indeed, for he would not come to
the law and testimony, but merely railed a-
gainst Brother Rigdon, calling him a granny,
and saying he loved apples and peaches bet-
ter than the truth, and that we must go be-
yond the written word now, as Joseph was
the mediator between God and the church;
thus setting Jesus Christ aside, virtually de-
nying the Lord that bought him.

After two or three vulgar and ridiculous
lectures of this sort, he called a church meet-
ing, and called on myself and the rest of the
brethren and sisters, to state their views of the
subject. I stated, that from a careful exami-
nation of the subject, I considered the twelve
could not be in their place, and that I could
not sustain them any longer. Ten or twelve
more of the oldest and best members of the
branch, expressed similar views, when he
made a motion that they be expelled from the
branch, which was carried. One of the elders
wished to know, as not one of us was tried
for any crime or transgression, what we were
cut off for,-whether for transgression or be-
lieving the Book of Covenants? Elder Ben-
son said it made no difference which.

Thus I have given you the present position
of affairs here. There is a branch of twelve
or fourteen members, determined to stand by
the law of the Lord, though they are railed at,
and called apostates, and charged with being
leagued with those who have shed innocent
blood; yea, even the blood of the prophets,-
and that too by professed saints of God. There
is nothing but what is laid to our, and our
brethren's charge: in fact, I never saw the

Elder Chrismon, a High priest direct from the
church in Nautoo, said a short time since, in Cin-
cinnati, that the twelve were not paying out much"
money on the temple, as they intended to use the mo-

they were now corresponding with James Emmett
