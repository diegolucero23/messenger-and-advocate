# SERMON No. 2.
DEDICATED TO THE SAINTS OF
THE LAST DAYS.

BY S. RIGDON.

Hebrews 2d chapter 6th verse: "What is man of that thou art mindfull of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?"

There has been much preaching, in the different ages of the world, about God the Father. Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, angels, devils, heaven and hell, time and eternity; but it is our intention to say some things about man: our text asks the question, "what is man?" and there is force given to the inquiry from what follows; "that thou art mindfull of him." That there must be importance attached to him since God is mindful of him, is certain; and every man must feel an interest in understanding himself; in inquiring into his own history; his present situation; his future destiny; the changes to which he is subject; his capabilities; his incapabilities; where he is from and whither he is going; and whether he had an existence before he was man; and, if so what change he underwent from the former to the present state; and whether he will cease to be man at any period of his existence; are all questions which we, as men, have a deep interest in, and, understanding which, could not fail to increase our intelligence, and that in relation to things which would be calculated to increase our happiness.

In order then to understand the inquiry in our text; we will say a few things about creation; a subject fraught with vast importance to all. Query what is creation? It is said to be God making all things out of nothing.- This may be true or it may be false for ought any man knows about it, to us they are words without any meaning; for we have no conception of nothing, and until we have we can have no idea of God manufactoring nothing into something. The people say Moses said so, if ite did, that would not alter the case, it wonld not give us power to conceive of nothing, neither would it give Moses power to do it; for Moses was as incapable to conceive of nothing as we are, and if Moses said so he used words without conveying any idea to his own mind or to others. When we speak of creation, we speak of it at a point where it is tangible; where the mind can conceive of it. In the history of creation given by Moses, we cannot conceive of it till he reaches the creation of man; at this point we can understand him, and the mind can conceive what he says, and then looking back on what

The has said, with the idea given us in the creation of man, there is a ray of light over the whole subject. He says that God formed a body out of the dust of the earth, and, after he had formed it, he put a spirit or life into it; of this we can conceive; we can conceive of God forming a body out of the earth, and we can conceive of his putting spirit into it, and of its then having life. Here is the point at which the history of creation becomes intelligent, and, with the idea Moses gives usin relation to man, we can form some idea of creation. We can conceive of God forming and fashioning matter so as to render it a habitation of spirit, and of his putting spirit into it when it is thus formed, and making one subservient to the purposes and benefit of the other for eternity; two things which originally were separate, being united, and be made mutually beneficial to each other forever; but to conceive of God making either out of nothing, is quite a different thing. The only conception we have of creation, is the uniting of body and spirit, and the forming and shaping of body for this purpose, and hence we learn that man is a combination of spirit and body, either of which is capable of a separate existence; but a spirit as separate from body, is not man, nor body separate from spirit, is not man; but the two united form man.

A query now suggests itself. Did the spirit which inhabits this body, exist before it was in the body? And if so, was it intelligent? That the spirit can exist without the body, and when separated from it, is so plainly taught that no believer in the Bible will attempt to deny it, and that it is capable of exercising all the rational faculties is equally certain. We have a singular account given us by the Savior, that puts this forever at rest. See Luke 16th chapter, from the 19th verse to the close of the chapter, to which we would direct the attention of the reader. The said conversation here related, was between twe disembodied spirits, Abraham and the rich man; by this conversation we learn much about spirits when separated from the body. They are capable of conversing with each other, of being tormented, and comforted, and they also take with them, in their disembodied state, the recollection of things which took place while, in the flesh, in this world; they retain the knowledge of their family relations, and carry with them the family affections and their desires for the welfare of their father's family, and, in their disembodied state, desire the salvation of their relatives which they have left in this world.

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.
PITTSBURGH, PA. JUNE 15, 1845.
E. ROBINSON Printer, $1 per an. in advance.
We have the pleasure of saying to the
saints that each week brings us cheering in-
telligence of the increase of truth amongst
men, and of the spread of the spirit of inquiry
in different parts of the country. This spirit
is apparently spreading without any effort on
our part, as letters addressed to us will show.
It has proved, as we always believed it would,
that when the Lord established his kingdom,
he would move it forward by an irrisistable
hand, without excitement or commotion, stir-
ing up the hearts of the people, and the honest
in heart to believe and obey his word, and
the testimony of his grace. In this city we
are baptising less or inore every week, and
there are a number now who have expressed
their intention to unite with us. In the
surrounding country there are doors opened
and opening for preaching, in different places,
within twenty miles of the city, and they
seem disposed to examine the subject with
candor, which cannot fail of producing convic
tion on their minds.
The elders whose business confine them in
the city, all find places to preach by going a
few miles into the country on Sunday, and
very respectable and attentive congregations.
We have never been in any part of the coun-
try where there has been so generala dispo-
sition to hear and investigate, as there is at
this time in the villages and country surroun-
ding this city.
This spirit of inquiry, has been awakened
without any particular efforts on the part of
the church; and the event is in the hands of
Him to whom pertains the kingdom, the
power, and the glory. It is only for the peo-
ple to investigate to insure belief; there is no
reasonable man, who has a desire to know the
truth as it is, but can come to a knowledge of
it, if he can lay aside the prejudices of his ed...

ucation, and receive the doctrine of Christ as it is written in the scriptures.

The great difference in principle, between us and others, is that we believe in direct rev-elations received from heaven, to direct the saints in the present day as in former days:-
and that the true church of Christ in every age of the world, have had and will have this privilege. That it has had it, in ages past, is not denied by any who believe in revelation; but men think there can be a true church of Christ in this age of the world, and that the church receive no revelations, nor have any of the powers or spiritual gifts of the primitive church.

If we understand those, who advocate this latter opinion, they believe that both these churches, the one which had the spiritual gifts and the one which has them not, are both the church of Christ. How this can be we are not told. Christ says of his church, "it is one," not two. Now how two things so dissimilar as a church having all the powers and spiritual gifts mentioned in the scriptures, and one having none of them, can be the same church is beyond our conceptions. According to our conceptions of things, two things which are different in every essential particular, are not the same; and until we can see how this can be possible, we will have to believe that a church without the spiritual gifts mention-ed in the New Testament, is not the church of Christ, or else the one with the spiritual gifts, was not the church of Christ, or else Christ must have two instead of one, and if this last is admitted, it is paramount to saying he never had one.

However deluded the world may call us, we will have to remain so, till we have minds sufficient to believe that two things are one. It was said to the saints of former days, - "If you were of the world the world would love you, but because you are not of the world therefore the world hate you." Nothing can be truer than this in our case, we share the enmity of Catholics, Protestants, and Mormons. This composes, the civilized world, and of course we are not of them, and the only reason is that we believe in obtaining revelations. - This the primitive saints did, and for it the world hated them. We are in good company.

We have been favored with a letter from our friend and brother Elder Lysander M.

Davis, of Georgia, extracts from which will be found in another column. We were happy to hear from him; and learn that he is still, as heretofore, a firm advocate of the truth: and notwithstanding the great apostacy which has taken place in the church of Latter Day Saints, we have additional testimony almost daily, that there are many of that people, who have not bowed the knee to Baal; but embraced the truth for the love of it, and will, ere long, renounce those who have turned the grace of our God into laciviousness. In reply to brother Davis we would say, that it is a strict observance of the principles of the fullness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ, as contained in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Book of Covenants, which alone will insure a man an inheritence in the kingdom of our God, and a place upon mount Zion, with the hundred forty and four thousand who are to stand as saviors in the last days; and will prepare those who obey and live by its precepts, for that Sabbath of rest which remaineth for the people of God, which is about to dawn upon the world.

All the evidence that is necessary to satisfy the most incredulous that Nauvoo is a sink of corruption, is the pitiable condescensions of that people to sustain themselves; there has been nothing like it in any age of the world, with which we are acquainted: there is no command of the Savior extant, which he delivered for the salvation of his people, but that people find themselves under the necessity of violating it in order to sustain themselves. Deception in its most forbidding forms, is resorted to by them, to make people think they are different from what they are in truth. They deny, or attempt to deny, the existence of the very doctrine on which they pretend that their exaltation depends:

No people that were honest in the religious belief, would thus dissemble. A true saint would publish his faith to the world, though he would suffer death for it; and rejoice in the thought that he suffered death for Christ's sake; but such means as they resort to, to support the truth, as they call it, shocks all common sense. Has it come to this, that men must lie, defame, and slander, in order to sustain the religion of Jesus Christ-write shameful anonymous letters, that the veriest blackguard in christendom would not dare mouth in the haunts of debauchery-bear false witness of every kind? and all this to support the truth of heaven. Write ignorant letters, and publish them in their papers, and

God has looked upon you, and beheld your shame; your abominations are a stink in the nose of Jehovah; your "turning things upside down," will not avail you. The storm of wrath is gathering, and it will burst on your heads as the whirlwind, and desolate you as the pestilence. Your city shall be desolated. for your inheritences are defiled under you. Your mouths are full of cursing and bitterness, the poison of asps is under your tongues, with your lips you utter deceit and falshood."

When the righteous rejoice you shall be in sorrow, when they are full you shall be hungry, when they are clothed you shall be naked; the day of your visitation drawech nigh, and the hour of your destruction is not slumbering; "death and hell is moved from beneath to receive you at your coming," and everlasting shame shall cover you forever and ever.

SIDNEY RIGDON

Pillsburgh, May 18, 1845.

Elijah R. Swackhammer. To the Editor of the Messenger and Advocate of the Kingdom and Church of Christ.

Beloved Brother:- This morning we left Beaver county, in order to porclaim the Kingdom, and the gospel of the Kingdom to the people of other towns and villages, that they also, may have an opportunity of having the gospel of their salvation and be saved by an obedience to it. Brother J. Hatch Jr and Brother Ellis also left, for the same purpose, and have gone to Washington, and other counties.

Our meetings were generally well attended, and the people were divided in there opinions as it respects the work-some contending for and some against it. We anticipate some being brought out of darkness into the light of God, in that section.

Přemit me sir; to relate a curious circumstance. We held two meetings in a certain village, and the house was well filled. The Kingdom and its gospel were the subjects of discurse the people seemed to be well satisfied-accordingly we left another appointment, and went to fulfill it-there were three or four persons present we left another appointment and went to fulfill it-not one person but those of the family. By this time we felt very anxious to know the cause, accordingly inquired particularly, and, was candidly inforined, by the people of the house that the people, with whom they had convers. ed said they had no faut to find with us, nor our doctrine but we were Mormons, therefore would not countenance us or come to hear us.

This notion of our being members of tha corrupt body of people originated in the faces of their having preached, in that section o the country, some things pertaining to the Kingdom and Chure of Chris; witch has been organized since they ceased to be ministers of righteousness; and all the truth, co mal-er by whom it is held, will be lodged in this kingdom, and church; and the name of any people, that holds some truth, may be applied to us with as much propriety as that of the Mormons. And if we are to be distingushed by former names we must be called the Mormon, Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, &c. &c. Church, for the members of the kingdom aud Church of Christ organized the 7th and 8th days of April 1845, in Pittsburgh Pa, are from a nong this, and almost every other class of people; and if those with whom we are not be inconnected in a church capacity, will admit that faith in Jesus of Nazarath, as the Son of God, and repentance toward God, and baptism in the name of Christ, by some one having authority from him, and the laying on of the hands such and prayer for the reception of the Holy Ghost, and the receiving of it, consti-tutes a body of people the Church of Christ, with officers in it according to the will of God, then we are entiteld to the name by which we are called, and which we wish to be known, by all people. And whether the people will, or will not, admit that the fors going is God's order of constituing hischurch and kingdom we know that it is, and that they do us great injustice in calling us by any other name. Therefore we hope that the brethren, they and all people, will call us by the right name. And be it known unto all, that every one whether mentbers of the Mormon or any other church, or of ho church, enter the kingdom and church of Christ, enter it by baptism. For Christ gave himself for the church that he might sanctify and cleans it with the washing of water in obedience to the word. And the apostolia Ephesian Church, after they had been baptised twice. were commanded to re-pent and be baptised againzor to do their first works, in the which baptism, of course, was included. See Acts the last of the 18th and first of the 19th, and Revelations 2nd. But the truth is, that there name, because of there ungodly deeds, is left for a curse unte us; as it is written, "and ye shall leave your name as a curseunto my chosen; for the Lord God shall slay thee; and call his servants by another nanie: That he who blesseth him-self in the God of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth and nothing but doing the will of God will cause the former troubles to be forgotten and to be hid from our eyes. And to all the saints to whom our office and calling pertains, we would exhortand beseech by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, as did our beloved brother Paul, not to be deceived, but

fered merch and the loss of all things we are
satished that we speak the truth in Christ and
lie not. And shall they, through whom God
has made the hearts of many to rejoice not
be sustained, in their effort to send the light
of the kingdom and Church of Christ to the
dark corners and places of the earth, that art
full of the habitations of cruelty. May the God
of this kin dom forbid it. Our beloved bro-
ther President Rigdon, has suffered more than
to die a thousand deaths, (and his family
*have suffiered with him) and all this that G.
might have a man prepared to stand before
him and organize his kingdon of the last
days. And we do speak the truth before God,
and lie not, when we say that his example
as a man, and as a saint, as a husband and
as a father, as a minister of Jesus Christ, and
as a citizen of his kingdom, is worthy of imi
tation, and shall not such a man he sustained?
in the cause in the which, not only we, but
the heavens are deeply interested; and shall
not the paper for which he writes be sustained
And if we love God, and his cause, and his
people, and his ministers let this love be
manifested to him, and to them, and to the
world by corresponding deeds. We have had
experience in the religious world for some
twelve years, and we are constrained to say
we are heartily sick of this love of the tongue
both toward God and his creatures. And now
we want to see a people that will rise up in
the strength of Isreal's God, and love not if
imerely in word neither in tongue but in deed,
according to the truth. And we would say
as did our beloved brother James. What
does it profit my brethren, though you have
faith and have not works? can faith save you?
And again. If a brother ora sister be na-
ked and distitute of daily food, and one of you
say unto them, depart in peace, be ye war-
med and filled, and give them not those things in
which are useful to the body what will ithe
benefit them. And how often have we seen in
it the case and have heard persons say to such as
were in distressed circumstances, "may the
Lord bless you" when they aught to have put if
there hand in there pockets and blessed them
themselves, or in some other way have blessed.
And though mankind has been most shame-
ing, that is no reason why
we should not do our duty to God, and to
each other and to all men. Therefore le is
those that have it in there power assist those,
who have it not in there power to assist them-
selves. And let those whom God has called
and chosen, and are fithful in his kingdom
and church, (and in this number we place first
our beloved President.) not to be forgotten that
his hands may not hang down, and that he
may be free to labour in his calling. For
remember that he has no salary settled upon
him neither has his fellow laborers in the
work of God, as other men in other churches.
Brethren beloved, we have unceasing de-
siresin behalf of those of whom we speak and
are for you and with tears rolling down our cheeks
we exhort you to do the will of God in all
things you may be counted worthy of his king-
dom for which we suff red. And let me say
in the name of the Lord that, you can have no
idea of the anxiety that brother Rigdon has for
you, unless God reveals it ro you by his spirit.
We, know tnis man and his family, his
house has been our home from before the or-
ganization of the kingdom, and we have an
opportunity to know them, that you have not
debut we know him from another source from
which it is the privilege of all to know him
and to know all about the work of God.
For the sake of the truth, we will add an-
other testimony in favor of this, our brother
and servant of the Lord for your and the
world's sake, which aught to be received in his
favor by all classes of mankind; which is,
that where he was born, and raised, where he
remained until his character was formed,
and where he took a public stand in the reli
gious world, and labored fi vears, in addi
tion to his having done business in the things of
this world a long time, even where he now lives,
the no one so far as my knowledge extends, has
had aught to say against his public, or private char-,
deter, and we have labored in this section of
country before, and since, president Rigdon'
returned to the place of his birth, and where
he formly labored, as a relgious teacher and
therefore have had every opportunity to know
if the people had aught to accuse him of.
And this is not all we have been favored with
the privilege of conversing with gentlemen
that have been acquainted with him from
his childhood.and with others and we are glad
to have it to, say that they have invariably had
something good to say about him or in his
favor. And it is unspeakably gratifiing to
have a man, of this character, holding the office
in the kingdom and Church of Christ that
he holds, and that the nearer we labor to him
in the vineyard of the Lord the less the op.
position; and to hear his old friends say "we
would like to hear Elder Rigdon preach, and
if he will come and preach for us we will do
our part in bearing his expences."
Brethren, there is no one thing more pleas-
ing, than that a man's character holding
the station that this our beloved brother holds
before God, and his brethren and the world,
is good enough to sustain itself, in spite of
all the opposition that may be against his reli-
gion. Brethien do be persuaded to act upon
the principle set forth in the following verses.
Romans 15: 2-6. "Let every ore of us
please his neighbor for his good to edification.
For even Christ pleased not himself, but, as
it is written, the reproaches of them that re-
proached thee fell on me. Now the God of pa-
tience and consolation grant you to be like-min-
ded one toward another according to Christ Je-
sus: That ye may with one mind and one mouth
glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Je-
sus Christs", Amen

BROTHER ROBINSON

I take this opportunity of writing a few lines to einforn you of mision thus far.- We left Brighten the 27th 1. crossed the Ohio at Beaver, and came to sheffield, a small town, where we stopped all night and preached to the citizens. We next came to Clinton. Day 10 miles, where we proclaimed the Kingdom and gospel of the Kingdom to a large and at- tentive congregation on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the people treating us very kindly.- A Mr Hood opened his house fof us in the eve- nings of Friday and Saturday and on Sunday we held our meeting in a grove, The Ceceders in that region are very bigoted and numerous, to endeavored to keep their members from coming out to hear us their doctrine received a death blow in the estimation of other classes, especially the 1 fidels; there are many of what the world (i. e. Sectarians call Infidels, who treated us most kindly and manifested much interest in our doctrina acknowledging that of it was that of the Scriptures. This would be a fine place for Bro her Savary. Next welly caine to Burgetstown where we preached but once next to Mt Peasant where we also lec- tured once hence to Cannonsburgh where we could not btain a house. We conversed with some citizens there, who were anxious to hear us and promised when we returned that they would secure a Hall for us, owned bya man who was absent from town. We left, and st stopped with a d with Mr... Mr. John Cooper about 3 miles North of Washington who is a full believer of our doctrine and who treated us with the utmost kindness. We gladened his heart and helours, He became a subscri- ber to our paper Brother Ellis wishes you to send to his address Mr. J. Cooper Washing- ton. We left 13 numbers with him and you will please forward them from the 13th num- ber, Since we left we have been in good spirits and met with very good treatment. Wherev- er we have preached the gospel, we have given ev ry and any person an opportunity to object to our to our doctrine, and not not one man has ever yet lifted his voice in opposition. We shall leave this for Waynesburgh, Green Co, next, and whether we shall go farther south we cannot tell. Weshall probably return through Westmoreland and arrive in Pittsburgh the first of July. We are growing stronger every day and have no fear of going among strangers. The farmers through the region we have travelled have suffered and are suffering much from drouth and frosts the pastures being dried up corn destroyed, fruit killed, and it is, feared much of the wheat crop injured severe- ly. There seems to be a fearful looking after those things that are coming on the earth.. Please to greet all the Brethren with our warmest and most friendly feelings. Your Brethren in the Gospel.

DEAR BROTHER in the New and Ever lasting Covenant, I take this opportunity to write you a few lines, lineg hoping they may find you in good health and prosperity. I believe the füless of the gospel off Christ as preach- ed by the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and embraced it, and was satis- fied with all until the death of Joseph; since then, there seems to be something wrong un der the authority of the Twelve, there are schisms in that body, and I cannot sustain them

I wish to know the truth as it is, we are commanded to prove all things and hold fast to that which is good. I feel that truth truth with. from bare investigation; and I desire to come to the truth as it is, and to sustain the same, and shall do it at all hazards; for truth's truth shall prevail, and error shall fall, and God's church will stand in these last days.

There is a branch of the church is this place of about 40 members, and it has become di- vided, and we feel we have been very very unjust- welly treated by those who are authorized with authority from the Twelve. I wish wish you would send me one copy of your paper, with- the terms, and I will send you the money:-

we wish, to spread light and truth in the world. I desire that every man should have his right, and shall labor for the same; and I feel that right will come, for I trust I trust in a right eous God, he will will bring all things right in his own due time.

I am your brother and friend in Christ,

PRESIDENT S. RIGDON

Dear Sir I accidentally learned you publish a paper at Pittsburgh, of which I nei- ther know the name or price: but I wish you to send it to me, to the amount enclosed.

I am ardently attached to the principles of the Gospel, as they have been taught by the Church of the Saints, and I wish to continue with a people, who believe and teach the same.

Since our last we have received a letter from Elder John A. Forgeus, dated Laharpe,

III. May 22, 1845, from which we make the following extract:

"Next Sunday I expect to preach 3 times in Montrose, lowa. I preached twice last Sabbath in McGary, Hancock county, Ill. 8 miles from Carthage, and made friends with Mormons, and anti-Mormons; in the evening at 5 o'clock I preached in Laharpe to a large congregation, and was followed by Elder S. James, There were ten ten baptized zed here on Saturday, and others soon will be?"
