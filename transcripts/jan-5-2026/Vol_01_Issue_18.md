# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE,
PITTSBURGH, PA. AUGUST 1, 1845.

thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandiments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the comming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember and perish not.

When a subscriber in the country, wishes to send for the Messenger and Advocate, he can now take a sheet of cap or letter paper, write us a long communication on it. and inclose a bank bill and send it 300 miles for five cents or any distance further for ten cents. As the price of our paper is very low, our friends must, in all cases, pay the postage on their letters. It will be but little for them, but it is very burthensome to us.

We wish our Agents to be particular, when they procure a subscriber or subscribers for our paper, and receive the money, as they should do, to forward with the name, the money so réceived, and not wait until they get more, as some have done; thereby keeping us out of our just dues for perhaps a long time.

Elder Rigdon has left this city on a mission east... How long he will be absent, is uncertain, as he will undoubtedly, visit several of the interior counties in this state, and set before them the principles of the gospel of the Son of God; after which, he may visit several of the eastern cities.

We will state for the information and comfort of the saints abroad, that the cause is prospering in this city. Scarcely a week passes, but more or less are baptized, and enter into the kingdom. Ten have been baptized the present week; prospects appear cheering; many are inquiring after the truth. We have many calls for Elders to go to different places and preach the word. May the Lord roll on his work with mighty power, and cut it short in righteousnes, is our earnest desire.

# THE PROPHECY OF ENOCH,
On the first page of this number, will be found an extract from the prophecy of Enoch, which was receieed by revelation, some years since. As it is a relic, too precious to be lost, we extract it for the benefit of the readers of the Messenger. It gives us a specimen of the power Enoch obtained with God, by faith, for we are told that by faith Enoch walked with God, and was not, for God took him." We trust that it will prove a stimulus, to the saints, to action, when they read of the great blessings enjoyed by the ancients, and consider that they were men of like passions with ourselves, subject to all the evils and temptations with which we are surrounded, and that the same God, who conferred upon them such great privileges, "is the same yesterday today and forever," and is "no respecter of persons," consequently is just as willing to hear and answer the prayers, and bestow as great blessings upon his children now, as in days gone by: therefore, beloved brethren, let us gird up our loins and be faithful; knowing that the days draw near, and the time is at hand, when the just shall stand by faith.

KIRTLAND.-Elder Rigdon has returned from his visit to Kirtland. He left a small branch of the church in that place, rejoicing in the Holy one of Israel; they feel strong in the work of the Lord, although their numbers are few. "The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong," but he who trusteth in the Lord God, shall prosper.

He delivered several lectures to large and attentive audiences; a good feeling and spirit prevailed; and much good, we trust, will result therefrom.

We would say to the church in Kirtland, and also, to all the saints, walk uprightly before God and all men; keeping your conscience void of offence; remembering to do the will of him who hath called you to your high and holy calling, with'an eye single to This glory; and the God of peace will bless you with the gift of his Holy Spirit, which shall be in you as a well of water springing up unto Eternal life. And although afflictions may come upon you, and persecutions may rage, yet your Heavenly Father will give you grace according to your day, and will render succor in every time of need; and will finally give you a place in the midst of that happy multitude which John saw upon Mount Zion, who had come up through "great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."

ness, than the Book of Mormon. Beside containing the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and a history of a once noble and mighty people, it also gives us, in plainness, simplicity, and truth, the principles of action by which we should be governed from day to day. An observance of which, will prepare us for usefulness in this life; and will also secure unto us an abundant admittance into that rest which remains for the people of God.

We find in its sacred pages, many blessings promised to the upright; to the virtuous; to the poor in spirit, who trust in the Lord: to the meek; to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness; to the mercifull; to the peace-maker, and to the pure in heart. But on the other hand, not a blessing, not a promise is recorded within its pages for the liar, the thief, the drunkard, the adulterer, the murderer, or for any worker of iniquity, except through repentance and an obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

For the benefit of our readers, who may not be in possesion of the foregoing Book, we make an extract in another column from its pages, the 2d chapter of Mosiah, which we trust will be found interesting

We have received a letter from Elder Jeremiah Hatch jr, dated, Carrol, Chetanqua co. N. Y. July 21, 1845, from which we make the following extracts:

Sectarianism is the powerless, and priestcraft, panic stricken, is struggling to shut out the light, which is exposing to open day, those systems which have chained down the minds of men for ages. The cry of delusion, of fanaticism is of no avail here, and the future is filled with the brightest images of hope.

MR. EDITOR:

Having an ardent desire for the continued spread of divine truth to all people, I have taken the liberty to write a few lines for the columns, if you should think them worthy of an insertion in so valuable a periodical as I deem yours to be. My mind has been more than usually awakened to the all-absorbing subject of true holiness before God and among men; of loving our neighbor as ourselves; of doing unto others as we would have them do unto us, &c. In order to come to a full understanding of the principles by which we may do these things, let us search the scriptures, and reduce to practice those ennobling precepts which we find therein recorded; which if we do, we shall be enabled to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth.

As saints of God, let us arouse every faculty of our souls to serve him with an undivided heart and mind, that we may obtain and enjoy that faith by which the saints anciently prevailed over all evil, and by which they held communion with the hosts of heaven, and through which they received such consolations as the world is, and has always been a stranger to. Let every brother and every sister be humble and meek, speaking the truth to all people; dealing justly, loving mercy, and becoming holy in all manner of conversation and conduct one with another, that those who now consider us deceivers, and deceived, by seeing our faith manifest in us by our good works, may be led to seek the like precious enjoyments, by embracing that plan of salvation which was devised before the world was, for the redemption of all who will believe and obey.

Let every saint purify their heart before the Lord, and keep them so, as he cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance; knowing if you do this, the kingdom is yours, and not many years hence the Lord Jesus will descend from heaven, and rescue his children from the power of their oppressors and give rest to the weary and those who are heavy laden. Therefore, beloved saints, do not become wearied in well doing, knowing you will surely reap your reward if you faint not.

# For the Messenger and Advocate.

MR. EDITOR:

Sir:-Permit me, through the columns of your paper, to illustrate the parable of the sower, which is recorded in Matthew's gospel, 13:3-8, as I understand it.- In the first place I would ask the reader, whoever he might be, this question, have you been baptized for the remission of your sins, and received the laying on of hands for the reception of the Holy Ghost, by one having an-all authority! If you have, you will understand the truth when you read; but if you have not, you will be at a loss. How so? your will ask.- Because you have not got that knowledge which Jesus Christ promised to those who would do his Father's will. You will find by reading John 7; 17, what he says on this subject. “If any man will do his will,” speaking of his Father, “he shall know wheth- or I speak of myself.” Now reader, Jesus came to do the will of his Father, and in so doing he sends forth his apostles in this wise, Mark 16: 15-18, “And he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, he that believeth and is baptiz ed-shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned, and these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name they shall cast out devil's; they shall speak with new tongues,' &c. The Holy Spirit opperating on them shewed the fruits of their obedience to gospel ordinances. Now reader if you will obey those ordinances you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, by which you can understand the sayings of the Son of God,

We shall now commence with the parable, “Behold, a sower went forth to sow: and when he sowed, some seeds feel by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up.- Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they wither a- way. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choke them. Butother fell into good ground, and brought at forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.-Mat. 13: 3-8.

Jesus drew the parable before us, as he did many others from the pastoral ocupations of the Jews. It may appear unnatural to some, that he should represent the seed which fell into good ground, as bringing forth fruit even to a hundredfold, this was a large increase, but it should be remembered that the land of Judea was very fertile.

Previously to attempting a particular ex- planation, of the parable, there is one circum- stance which we think worthy of the reader's attention. By the seed sown, was intended the word of God; and by the soil into which it was cast, the heart and understanding of man. Now as there is no contradiction in nature be- tween the seed and the soil, so we infer that

the nature of the human heart is not opposed to the gospel of Christ. It men are totally opposed to the gospel in their natures pre- vious to their conversion, it is but a poor figure the Savior uses when he represents his word by the seed, and the hearts and under- standings of men by the soil in which it is sown.

According to the representation of this par- able, the knowledge of religion is natural to all mankind; the seed of it is sown in the bad ground as well as in the good; it is not the ac- quisition only of a few thoughtful and contem- plative men, but arises directly and immedi- ately from certan principles and powers essen- stially belonging to the human form, so that no man can have it to say, he did not bring forth this fruit because the seeds of it, the principles of religious knowledge were never sown in his mind. Secondly, we may observe, that a- mong the various bad soils here mentioned by our Savior, there are none of them described as being naturally bad; if therefore our minds are in a religious and moral sense unfruitful to this is owing to our own corruption of them and not to any inherent depravity or barren- ness in the soil itself. The great object of Je- sus in uttering the parable of the sower, was to show the different ways in which the truth would be received by different orders of men. The explanation, as given by our Lord himself, will be found in verses 18-23, the seed was sown under four different circumstances and in the explanation Jesus showed that there were four different kinds of hearers of the word.

First, there were those who heard the word but did not understand it, verse 19. The word preached to them was the seed which fell by the way side, and which the fowls of the air- came and devoured. Hence it is said that when the word is preached to a man who did not understand it, then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. It was not difficult for the wicked a-enemies of Jesus to take away the word of the gospel from the hearts of those who did not understand it; their great object was to pre- vent men from embracing the religion of the blessed Redeemer, they took away the key of knowledge from the people-they shut up the kingdom of heaven against men--neither en- tering themselves nor suffering those who would enter to go in-and they were represent- ed by the fowls who came and devoured the seed.

Secondly: There were those who heard the word and received it with joy, but they were men of instability and endured only for a while; for when tribulation or persecution arose on account of the word they had professed, they became offended and gave it up. When the word was preached to this class, it was rep- resented by the seed which fell upon stony places, where there was but little earth; it sprung quickly up as seed does when slightly covered, and having but little root it could not

these few lines, in order to receive some counsel concerning the future gathering place for the saints. I am a native of Bern in Switzer-Jand, came to America in 1829, settled near Madison, obeyed the gospel in August 1844. was baptized by elder Lorenzo Wells, and soon afterwards ordained an Elder. Since that time I contemplated to sell my estate, and remove to Nauvoo in order to be perfected in the ways of the Lord, truly believing that city to be a city of holiness; but through family circumstances was always prevented in so do-ing, my wife being opposed to go there. A-bout two years ago it pleased the Lord to take her from this earthly life, leaving me a wido-wer with seven small children. My desire to move to Nauvoo became every day stronger and I tried every way to sell my farm, even at a considerable loss, but could not find a chance. until lately a gentleman told me that he would buy it about next fall or winter if he could re-alise the money. Having now that opportu-nity, it only remains for me to know where to go, as there has taken such a change in the af-fairs of the church, that I shall not go to Nau-voo.

As I desire to serve the Lord, and believe that the doctrine of Christ goes hand in hand with the strictest obser-vance of moral conduct, I feel myself bound to discontinue fellowship with the church at Nauvoo.

As to the first presidency of the church, my mind was always settled on that point, I take the revelations of God for my guide, they are very clear and plain about it. I believe with all my heart that president SIDNEY RIGDON is the lawful successor of Joseph Smith, and cheerfully acknowledge him as such. Indeed I do not know how it were possible that the twelve could so far apostatize as to cut him off he being higher in authority than they, (the twelve.) And how will the Mormons at Nauvoo be able to sustain an organization of the kingdom of God, without a prophet and without a first Presidential triune, I cannot see.

I have to go through many tribulations, yet I stand having been preserved so far by the hand of our heavenly Father. I still (although alone,) believe the book of Mormon, and Doc-trine and Covenants true, and rejoice in the work of the Lord in the last days. Being but an imperfect English scholar, I hope and trust the time is not far distant when the gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in my native language,(the German.) My heart's desire is to obey the gospel and belinducted into the kingdom of God, as soon as an Elder shall visit this part of the country.

I shall probably visit Pittburgh some time this tall. I am very happy to have the oppor-tunity to hear of the great work by your paper. I remain respectfully yours,
in the bonds of the everlasting covenant.
LEWIS DE BUREN.
TO E. ROBINSON.

# Pittsburgh, July 23, 1845.

## BROTHER L. DE BUREN:-

Dear Sir: Your kind letter of July 15, just came duly to hand, and its contents peru-sed with pleasure; and in reply, I will say as you very truly remark in your letter, "The gospel of Christ goes hand in hand with the strictest observance of moral conduct;" and to deviate in the least degree, from the principles of righteousness and uprightness, and persist in that diviation, will forfeit any man's stand-ing before God, will grieve the Holy Spirit, and cause darkness to overwhelm the mind, when that person is prepared to partake of al-most any pleasing error, and to do almost all manner of iniquity, having lost the lamp which guides the feet of the saints, and substi-tuted in its place his own carnal desires, and the spirit of that evil one, which are at enmity with every principle of godliness, holiness and virtue.

When we look at the matter with our natu-ral understanding, we are led to marvel great-ly, that a people once enjoying the sweet in-fluence of the Holy Spirit, and having the history of the Jews and Nephites before them; (their rise and progress, and the great and manifold blessings wherewith the Lord bless-ed them, when faithful before him; and their sudden and awful destruction when they pre-verted their ways before the Lord;) should have so soon forgotten the rock from whence they were hewn, and entered with greediness into the very same abominations and crimes which wrought the overthrow and ruin of those ancient people of God. How forcibly is brought to bear the sayings of our Savior, "if that light which be in you become darkness, how great is that darkness."

I know, dear brother, that inasmuch as Je-rusalem was destroyed for the transgression and wickedness of its inhabitants, so will Nauvoo share the same awful fate for practising the same wickedness and abominations before the Lord; for God is not man that he should change, nor the son of man that he should re-pent of his doings; neither will he be mocked hy those who profess to know his name.

Directly after the death of Joseph Smith, and about the time the church at Nauvoo re-jected Elder Rigdon, and the law of God, by voting that they did not want a Prophet to lead them, the Lord pointed out to. Elder Rigdon the course he should pursue, and at the same time gave him the pattern for the organization of the kingdom of God as spoken of by Dan-iel; which organization took place agreeably to the heavenly communication and pattern, at the conference in this city, commencing on the sixth of April A. D. 1845. The laws and regulations governing which kingdom you will find contained in the 11th and 12th No's. of the Messenger, the grand fundamental prin-ciple of all of which, is, "to love the Lord our God with all our heart, might, mind, and

# From the Ensign.-BY REQUEST.

G. M. HINKLE TO W. W. PHELPS

Buffalo, Scott County I T.,

To W. W. PHELPS, Esq., Nauvoo, Ill.

My dear Sir, After so long a time, I take up my pen to address a few lines to you, and thus break that perfect silence "which has existed between us ever since we parted in far West, Missouri, in the Fall of 1838. Then you and I were both dissenters from the church of Latter Day Saints;' though we did not dissent upon exactly the same princi- ples for I only dissented from the unwise, unhallowed management of the heads or au- thorities of the church, and not from any true points of doctrine which I ever had believed.

But you said to me that you dissented from the whole Mormon system.

Since then I have been told by good author- ity, such as Hyrum Smith and others, that you have returned to the bosom of the church. and been received again to fellowship, and all seems to be well with you if you are happy and in the course you are now taking, all I have now to say to you is, at the tribunal of heaven you will have to answer for all your deeds done in the body.

But Sir, there is one point upon which I wish to address the Latter Saints through you, in order that the honest hearted and ignorant minded may be corrected, and the malicious hearted slanderers put to shame. It has been the theme of many since I left Missouri, to calumniate and vilify me for the course, which I, as the acting Colonel of the Militia of Caldwell, pursued in the surren- der of the citizens of Far West, Caldwell.&c.; il to the authorities of Missouri. Those vilifiers have stated it, and vociferated its repetition throughout the length and breadth of our hap- py land and the newspapers of the day have thrown it upon the wings of the wind, and no doubt it has gone to the old world, and there of been listened to and credited-especially by those of your faith-hat I, as a base wretch, after having the confidence of the church-yet in that critical montent of their perils in Mis souri, when they in and of Far West were besieged by between three and four thousand men-the story is, that I, there and then, be- trayed the Heads of the Church' into the hands of the Military authorities of Missouri, and that too, for a large sum of money!. And then, as if they intended to heap disgrace upon me, after insult and injury, they say I turned state's evidence against them:-also, that I informed on many of the citizens of Farrites West, had them arrested and delivered up to the court of inquiry, to be punished. And he many such like reports have been put in cir- culation by my enemies to do me injury; all of which, before God, I declare to be as false as Satan himself.

Now Sir, you are the man who knows more

about it than any other man belonging to your church. You know that you, John Corrill, A. Morrison, and myself, were appointed by Joseph Smith to go and confer with the com- manding officers of the Missouri Militia, and effect a treaty if possible, on any terms short of a battle. You know that we went and risked our lives with a white flag, when only a few hours previous, the bearer of one (Charles Rich,) had been fired at on the same field: Then end we did this to obey the order or request of Joseph Smith. Our object was (at least 1 did felt so;) to prevent the effusion of blood, which we all saw must inevitably take place, unless something could be immediately done.- Were you not present Sir, at that trying.scene? when the eyes of our enemies seemed to flash fire when we approached, and I received from the hand of Major General Lucas that unhal- lowed paper, narrating to us the terms upon which the lives of our families and friends could be saved-viz: "Give up your leaders- your principle men, as hostages to be tried by civil law. Give up all your arms of defence, and ALL leave the State forthwith." He also read to us that generous-no-that exe- crable order of Governor Boggs, authorizing him to exterminatè us, or drive us from the State. Now Srr, I appeal to your candor: did I, at this critical moment, say to General Lucas, or to any of those with him, Give me a sum of money, Judas like, and I will com. ply? If you answer in the affirmative, then query, were you and the others of the delega leftion to go partners with me in such an unhal- lowed speculation? What! thns to betray our frienps-our brethren into the hands of their implacable enemies in the hour of their per and that too for Missouri gold!!! Or if I did, as has been reported by men-high in au- thority among you, winked at by all, and not contradicted by any-at least so far as I know -did I take the price and snugly lodge it all in my own pocket, without dividing with any of you? You know I did not make that treaty alone. Nay, you well remember that your- self and the others with us, by authority, or request of Joseph Smith himself, agreed to the disgraceful terms. We then urged all to sub- mit. But did I not then and there oppose that part of the order requiring us to give up jour arms and immediately leave the State, ur- ging that if any had offended by breaking the law, we were willing and even anxious that such should be punished to the exient of jus- tice, or the magnitude of the crime-but to give up our arms and leave the State, would be virtually throwing away our most sacred Farrites as citizens of a republican state; and that we would as aoon give up our lives? Did he not become enraged and say that Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Lyman Wight, P. P. Pratt, and G. W. Robinson must be given up; and no other terms would do? Did he not give us half an hour to consult our friends? When the facts were laid before Joseph, did
