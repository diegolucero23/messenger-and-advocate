# ESSAY ON THE GOSPEL.

BY 8. RIGDON.

Whatever difference may exist in the world about the scheme of eternal life, and the duties enjoined upon the human family to prepare them for its enjoyment, all, we believe, who acknowledge the truth of the bible, agree in this, that the ancient apostles, commissioned by the Savior, were fully authorized to proclaim the gospel, and to make known the will of God to man, and that the things which were taught by them were correct; and the gospel which they preached was God's only scheme of life; and that adding to it, or taking from it, deprived mankind of the benefits resulting therefrom, and tended to disarm the plan of eternal life of its powers.

We believe that it is universally admitted by all believers in revelation, that no persons could receive into their hearts, the things taught by these men, and practice the duties they required, without obtaining the promises made by them; for if this were not the case, it would be worse than folly to hold them up to view as messengers sent of God to bless the nations.

The point of light in which these apostles are held up to view in the scriptures is, that the gospel which they preached was the only gospel, acknowledged of God, and the proclamation which they proclaimed, the only one that men were authorized to receive, and the promises which they made, were to be as certainly enjoyed, as ever men put themselves in a situation to receive them, by obeying the instructions which they gave them. For though religion in some form was prevailing in every part of the civilized world in the days of the Savior and his apostles, still they presented themselves to the world as the only persons who were capable of enlightening the minds of men, and of bringing them into an acquaintance with the true faith, and of introducing them into the family of the Most High, having (as they said) authority from God to do this work, and that a dispensation of the gospel was committed to them for this purpose.

The professed object of their apostolic mission was, that men night be saved: this their commission clearly.sets forth. "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be damned!" From this it is plain, that whatever might have been the amount of religion in their day, there was not a sufficiency of righteousness on earth to save one man, only as it was restored to the world through the Savior and his apostles,

nor was it possible for one single creature in all the world to be saved unless they put themselves under their guidance; for they were to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, so that every creature in the world, had to be taught by them, and receive the gospel which they preached, or else they must be damned: for they who believed not should be damned. This was certainly placing their commission in an important point of light: and their own teachings were in perfect consistency with their commission. Paul says, when writing to the Galatians, first chapter, 8th and 9th verses, "But though we, or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed." In all their teachings they held themselves up to view as the only teachers of righteousness which were approved of God in the world, and that their mission was not necessary only for the salvation of a part of the world, but all of it; yea every creature in it. It mattered not what progress the world had made in the knowledge of other things: in the knowledge of the science of salvation, they had retrograded, until there where none doing good, no not one. And unless God had sent the apostles, or others authorized as they were, the world must have perished: every creature in it must be damned: for they were to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, he, (that is, every creature) that believed and was baptized should be saved; but he, (that is, every creature) that believed not, should be damned. Had there been one creature in all the world who was in a state of salvation, or could have attained that state without the apostles, this commission would not have been correct, that is, that every creature in all the world who did not believe them and be baptized by their direction should be damned.

Nothing can make the apostles' commission true, but the fact, that no creature in all the world could be saved without their being brought into favor with God through their ministry.

The Savior, through the whole course of his ministry in the flesh, makes it one of the principle items of teachings to make it clearly manifest to the religious Jews, that they had departed from the principles delivered unto them through the messengers whom God had inspired to make known his will to men. He

# ON PERFECTION.

We have often heard individuals, who advocate the Arminian doctrine, talking about perfection, and even pretending that they are ensamples of the perfect class, when indeed they are not only ignorant of the principle, but destitute of the necessary qualifications, which are prerequisites to so high a standing.

Perfection in the extended import of the word, is that which is beyond improvement. Christ commanded his people, saying: "Be'ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect." We do not understand from this, that mankind while in a state of probation on earth, are to becoine perfect in all things, as the Lord is, or to that degree that he is; but that we have appointed unto us a certain sphere to act in, and that we can be perfect in it; and that we have certain laws to comply with, and we can harmonious-ly do it. The Lord is perfect in all things, and he governs the whole universe, and every planet pursues its course without interfering with others; for there is order and harmony in all the works of God: for he is the fountain of intelligence, and the first in power; and every thing that he does will be perfect when complete. The formation of this earth is the work of God, and when entirely finished, it will be crystallized, and made pure, and even glorified, or be perfect; although it has its orbit to act in, and with order and harmony does it. So it is with men, they have their sphere to act in, and they can be perfect in it; but God has the immensity of space to act in, and he is perfect in it. It is not to be expect-ed that mankind are required to be perfect in all things, while in a state of mortality, as God is. His power is unlimited; but we have a certain sphere to act in; therefore, our intel ligence is limited; but as we have before stated, we can be perfect in this sphere; or in other words we can obey the laws of the Lord; walk circumspectly, orderly, and har-moniously before him. Therefore, we are disposed to enquire into the nature of the sphere, we have to act in, and so learn how we can be perfect in it.

There are certain principles of power that are within the reach of man while he is alas a probationer in time, and there are many things beyond his reach; but as far as his power extends, or that he has power over thinge, he has the power of choice and free agency to act for himself; and his sphere that he has to act in, extends no-farther than he has power to obey or disobey. Hence in our opinion the perfection that a man may attain to in time, consists in obeying the law of righteousness, and obtaining the promised blessings of the gospel of peace, which are within his sphere.

Right and wrong are before him and he has power to do either; but if he does that which is right and obeys the law of the Lord in all things, he is a perfect man, as far as his sphere extends. But it is impossible for a man to attain to this high standing without a perfect law of rule to guide him. No law can be in justice presented to a man for his sanction and obedience, which is beyond his power or the power given him to obey; there-foré no law can be a perfect one, that exacts things of men that they cannot perform. The law of God is infallible or perfect, because God who is infallible or perfect, devised it, and it does not exact things of men that they cannot do. If this_law is perfect, and also the principle by which a man-is-made perfect; or in other words, that he cannot be perfect without obeying it, then if he rejects one principle of it, he is not perfect in his sphere.- James, no doubt, alluding to the gospel says: "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."-James, i. 25. This perfect law of liberty expande the mind, and liberates it from the vulture fangs of bigotry, which has ever infused the idea that the sphere of man, is very contract ed, and that certain blessings that were in the power of man to receive in ancient days, are beyond the reach of man in this our day.

It is admitted that if a person complies with the rules of a science in all respects, that he will become as perfect as the rules themselves are, likewise if a man obeys the gospel in all respects, he will be perfect as far as the law or the gospel will allow him to be.- Therefore, we set it down as a fact that no man is perfect, no not even in his own sphere, except he obeys the gospel, and in vain may we talk about being perfect, sanctified or holy, if we have not obeyed the gospel, nay if we have not obeyed every principle of it. We are induced to believe that there are many who profess to be perfect, that have not obeyed the fulness of the gospel, and do not even believe that the promised blessings of the gospel of peace, by which our knowledge is in-creased, are for them; and indeed, they are ig-norant of the means by which they can be made perfect..

Now according to the scriptures the matter that stands thus-we are commanded to be perfect alas our Father who is in heaven is perfect, and as there is order and perfection in all his works, or as he has adopted certain rules, and he conforms to them; so must we conform to the law of the Lord or the gospel, in all respects, or it cannot be said in truth that we are perfect. When we say that the Lord acis con-formably to certain rules, we mean to be understood that he has devised certain rules for his own course and procedure: for instance it is written that he cannot lie. The reason is, lit would be a breach of the law that he has

# LECTURE 1.-ON FAITH.

AMOS B. TOMLINSON.
From the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. SECTION 1.

1.  Faith being the first principle in revealed religion, and the foundation of all righteousness, necessarily claims the first place in a course of lectures which are designed to unfold to the understanding the doctrine of Jesus Christ,
2.  In presenting the subject of faith, we shall observe the following order:
3.  First, Faith itself what it is:
4.  Secondly, The object on which it rests; and
5.  Thirdly, The effects which flow from it,
6.  Agreeably to this order we have first to show what faith is.
7.  The author of the epistle to the Hebrews, in the 11th chapter of that epistle, and 1st verse, gives the following definition of the word faith.
8.  "Now faith is the substance (assurance) of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
9.  From this we learn that faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of the things which they have not seen; and the principle of action in all intelligent beings,
10. If men were duly to consider themselves, and turn their thoughts and reflections to the operations of their own minds, they would readily discover that it is faith, and faith only, which is the moving cause of all action in them; that without it, both mind and body would be in a state of inactivity, and all their exertions would cease both physical and mental.
11. Were this class to go back and reflect upon the history of their lives from the period of their first recollection, and ask themselves, what principle excited them to action, or what gave them energy and activity, in all of their lawful avocations, callings, and pursuits, what would be the answer? Would it not be that it was the assurance which we had of the existence of things which we had not seen, as yet? Was it not the hope which you had in consequence of your belief in the existence of unseen things, which stimulated you to action and exertion, in order to obtain them? Are you not dependant on your faith, or belief, for the acquisition of all knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence? Would you exert yourselves to obtain wisdom and intelligence, unless you did believe that you could obtain them? Would you have ever sown, if you had not believed that you would reap? Would you have ever planted, if you had not believed that you would gather? Would you have ever asked, unless you had believed that you would receive? Would you have ever sought, unless you believed that you would have found? Or would you have ever knocked, unless you had believed that it would have been opened unto you? In'a word, is there any thing that you would have done, either physical or mental, if you had not previously believed? Are not all your exertions, of every kind dependant on your faith? Or may we not ask, what have you, or what do you possess, which you have not obtained by reason of your faith? Your food, your raiment, your lodgings, are they not all by reason of your faith? Reflect, and ask yourselves if these things are Cot so? Turn your thoughts on your own minds, and see if faith is not the moving cause of all action in yourselves; and, if the moving cause in you, is it not in all other intelligent beings?
-12. And as faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so it is in spiritual; for the Savior has said, and that truly, that he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. Mark xvi. 16.
13. As we receive by faith all temporal blessings that we do receive, so we in like manner, receive by faith all spiritual blessings, that we do receive. But faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth. Thus says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, xi. 3,
14. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God: so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
15. By this we understand that the principle of power, which exists in the bosom of God, by which the worlds were framed, was faith; that it is by reason of this principle of powy, existing in the Deity, that all created things exist so that all things in heaven, on earth, or under the earth, exist by reason-of faith, as it existed in Him.
16. Had'it not been for the principle of faith, the worlds would never have been framed, neither would man ever have been formed of the dust-it is the principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power over all temporal, as well as eternal things. Take this principle or attribute (for it is an attribute) from the Deity, and he would cease to exist.
17. Who cannot see, that, if God framed the worlds by faith, that it is by faith that he exercises power over them, and that faith is the principle of power? and that, if the principle of power, it must be so in man as well as in the Deity? This is the testimony of all the sacred writers, and the lesson which they have been endeavoring to teach to man.
18. The Savior says, Matthew xvii. 19, 20, in explaining the reason why the disciples could not cast out the devil, that it was be- cause of their unbelief: "For verily I say unto you," said he "if ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it

# What is it?

It is the principle of power also. §1. ¶ 13.

# How do you prove it?

First, It is the principle of power in the Deity, as well as in man Heb. 11:3. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. §1. ¶ 14,15,16.

Secondly, It is the principle of power in man also. Book of Mormon, page 264. Alma and Amulek are delivered from prison. Do. page 421. Nephi and Lehi, with the Lamanites, are immersed with the Spirit. Dos page 565. The mountain Zerin, by the faith of the brother of Jared, is removed. Josh. 10:12. Thenspake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. Josh. 10:13. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. Mat. 17:19. Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? Mat. 17:20. And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbe-leif: for verily I say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Heb. 11:32. And what shall I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Sampson, and of Jephthah, of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets. Heb. 11:33. Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises. stopped the mouths of lions, Heb. 11:34. Quenced the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Heb. 11.35. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better Tesurrection. §1. ¶ 16,17,18,19,20,21,22.

# How would you define faith in its most unlimited sense?

It is the first great governing principle, which has power, dominion and authority over all things. § 1. ¶ 24.

# How do you convey to the understanding more clearly, that faith is the first great governing principle, which has power, dominion, and authority over all things?-

By it they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain, agreeably to the will of God, and without it had there is no power; and without power there could be no creation, nor existence! §1. ¶ 24.

# SINGULAR-PHENOMENON ON LAKE ONTARIO.

On Saturday last, an extraordinary occurrence was noticed in the lake at this place... Shortly before noon, some gentlemen walking upon the wharf, happening to cast their eyes upon the water, between the piers, were struck with the very unusual appearance of a strong current tide, as it were, setting directly out to sea. It seemed as if the whole lake was going bodily away. In a few minutes nearly a third past of the inner harbor, with a corresponding portion of the shore on either side, was left entirely bare, when suddenly the tide turned and came as rapidly back again, filling the harbor at least two feet higher than it was before. This extraordinary action of the lake was continued at regular intervals of every eight or ten minutes till after dark; the highest tide noticed being a little before six in the evening, and when the water rose seven inches higher than it was last spring, and just two feet and an inch above its present level. We understand the same occurrence was noticed at other places on the lake, and we hear that at Port Hope the effect was so great that the steam boat of Princess Royal could not get into the harbor at all, running hard aground when more than her length outside the entrance to the piers. The cause of so extraordinary a phenomenon is at present a matter of various conjectures, but the general opinion seems to be that it could only have been produced by a violent earthquake in some other part of the continent which we shall probably soon hear of.

From the Pittsburgh Chronicle of Oct. 15

MORMON NEWS.-- We copy the following from the St. Louis Republican of Monday the 6th:-"Our correspondence from Warsaw states the result of the deliberations of the Anti-Mormon convention at Carthage last week. Nine of the adjoining counties were represented, and it will be seen that they resolved that the Saints must leave by spring. As the official proceedings have not yet reached us, we are unacquainted with the mode proposed to effect this object, but hope it may be such as to leave no doubt on the subject. We learn by the Die Vernon that Gen Hardin had arrested Backenstos, and it was said, intended to send him to Springfield with what object we are not informed. Nauvoo was quiet, and Gen. Hardin had left the place with the forces under his command."

End of the Mormon War. By documents published in the St. Louis Republican, we learn that the Mormons have entered iuto-a definite arrangement to leave Illinois in the spring, in a body, for some place west of the Rocky Mountains. This arrangement has been amicably agreed upon in fact, the Mormons say they had intended going at any rate, had the disturbance not taken place. A small military force will be kept in the county to preserve order until the removal takes place.

## SECOND ADVENT.
Come, O! thou King of Kings!
We've waited long for thee,
With healing in thy wings,
To set thy people free;
Come thou desire of nations, come,
Let Israel now be gathered home.

Come, and make an end of sin,
And cleanse the earth by fire,
And righteousness bring in,
That saints may tune the lyre,
With songs of joy in happier strains,
To welcome in thy peaceful reign,
Hosannahs now shall sound
Ergut all the ransomed throrg,
And glory echo round
A new triumphal song;
The wide expince of heav'n fill
With anthems sweet from Zion's hill.

Hail! Prince of Life and peace,
Thrice welcome to thy throne,
While all the chosen race,
Their Lord and Savior own;-
The heathen nations how the knee, '
And every tongue confess to thee.

# UNIVERSITY
OF THE
"Literary and Botanico-Medical College of the
State of Ohio," at Cincinnati:-
ESTABLISHED BY LAW.

COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS.
The following gentlemen compose the Fac-
ulty:-

DOCTOR CURTIS, Professor of the In-
stitutes, and Practice of Medicine; Materia
Medica, Pharmacy, and Therapeutics; Pa-
thology, and Hygiene.

DOCTOR HILL, Professor of Anatomy;
Physiology, and Surgery.-

ric Medicine in the "Willoughby University
of Lake Erie.")

A Charter incorporating the "Literary and
Botanico-Medical College of the State of
Ohio," with the most plenary University
powers, was granted by an act of the Legisla-
ture in March, 1839, since which time its
Medical Department-the College of Physi-
cians and Surgeons-has been in successful.
operation. It is the oldest Botanico-Medical
College in the United States, and its patron-
age has been encouraging. The advantages
for professional study and the acquisition of
correct knowledge in Anatomy, Surgery, Prac-
tice of Medicine, and Obstetrics, are not sur-
passed by those of any other Medical Institu-
tion in the United States. The Medical and
Surgical Clinique attached to the University
will afford opportunities for Hospital Practice,
in addition to other similar facilities; and those
persons requiring assistance in the operative
departinents, who will submit to the clinical
observation and inspection of the class, will,
during the lecture season, be operated upon
gratuitously. Many important operations are
performed on the living subject, and the
whole theory and practice are carefully taught
Jand illustrated on the cadaver. Physiology
is illustrated with the Manikin, the most
wonderful exhibition of art an instrument
by the aid of which an amount of knowledge
that it once required years to obtain, can be
communicated in as many weeks. Pathology,
diagnosis, and therapeutics, will be illustra..
ded abundantly in the college. The principal
articles of the Materia Medica, both crude and
prepared, will be exhibited so constantly, as
to enable the student to become acquainted
with the agents he is to use in his profession.
The chemical apparatus, the botanic garden,
and a great variety of maps, diagrams, paint-
enings, &c., complete the means of illustration.
We feel happy in assuring the public that
we have, now, associated with us, gentlemen
who will answer every reasonable expecta-
tion. And we are all determined to give the
community, particularly the friends of medi
cal reform, an opportunity to remove from the
general practitioners of the new system, the
popular charge of ignorance, and empyricism.
Will you sustain us? We shall see!

The lectures in this University will com-
mence on the first Monday in November, at
the college Edifice, on 3rd Street, between
Broadway and Ludlow, and continue four
months. There will be at least five REG.
ULAR LECTURES, daily, for five days in-
each week; (Saturdays being occupied by
the Medical Society connected with the col-
lege.) and occasionally, an extra evening lec-
ture, on miscellaneous subjects collaterally
connected with medical science.
As there will be no summer course here-
after, those who desire the advantages of this
Institution will avail themselves of the WIN-
TER SESSION.

The fees for a full course of Lectures,
Matriculation included, amount to $80, IN
ADVANCE. Diploma, $20. A full course.
of Lectures will be delivered on Dental Sur-
gery, by an able. Dentist of this city, for
which an additional fee of $2 will be charged.

# PROSPECTUS
FOR THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE

OF THE
### CHURCH OF CHRIST.
-0000000000-
As the first volume of the MESSENGER AND
ADVOCATE is drawing to a close, we deem it
advisable to give our patrons and friends an
early notice of our intention to continue its
publication.
The comencement of this paper was under
circumstances very peculiar and trying. We
were under the painful necessity of lifting our
pens and voices against an apostacy the most
daring, and of opposing doctrines the most
revolting, demoralizing, and destructive, that
ever mortals were called upon to witness; es
pecially in a civilized community; and we
think it exceedingly doubtful if the hi the history of
the most barbarous or heathen nations can
show a parallel; we mean the private teachings
and practices of the leaders at Nauvoo.
To save the church of Christ from an entire
ruin and overthrow, required an effort worthy
of the high and exalted end to be obtained.-
This effort we felt willing to make, agreably
to the requirements of our heavenly Father,
knowing that with his aid and blessings this
glorious object could be accomplished; and we
have the unspeakable privilege of seeing that
