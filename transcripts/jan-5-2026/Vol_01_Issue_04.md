# THE CELESTIAL LAW.

"And they. who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto you; even the law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that of a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom, For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom, cannot abide a celestial glory: and he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom, cannot abide a terrestrial glory: he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide a telestial glory: therefore, he is not meet for a kingdom of glory. Therefore, he must abide a kingdom which is not a kingdom of glory."

"For what doth it, profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receiveth not the gift? Behold he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift."

And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law, is also preserved by law, and perfected and sanctified by the same, That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, or judgment. Therefore they must remain filthy still.

All kingdoms have a law given: and there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either a greater or lesser kingdom. And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also, and conditions,

All beings who abide not in those conditions, are not justified; for intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy hath compassion on mercy, and claimeth its own; justice continueth its course, and claimeth its own; judgement goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the throne; and governeth and executeth all things; he comprehendeth all things. and all things are before him, and all things are round about him; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things; and all things are by him, and of him,even God, forever, and ever." $ 7, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10,

If there is a principle which is pre-eminently set forth in the revelations of heaven, and engraved with the luminous energy of the Spirit of God, upon the sacred page, it is the inviolability of the law of God. A knowledge of that law and subiection thereto, is the only road to the special favor and approbation of Him, who cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance. The womb never opened to give birth to the man, who was not amenable to the requirements of the Supreme Governor, Law-giver, and Judge of all the earth; inasmuch as those requirements were known to him. The immaculate Son of God himself, one of the heavenly triune, readily responded to the majesty and inviolable character of that law, by yielding to its minutest requisitions a cheerful obedience.

Let it be remembered, and cherished in the inmost recesses of the heart of man, that the enactments of the law of God, are no capricious and arbitrary principles, to which we are required to bow, as to the will of a tyrant, for the sake of enforcing subjection to authority; but result from those eternal, immutable, and unalterable principles, which can alone secure the happiness and exaltation of intelligent beings. They are principles which we must of necessity, adopt, if we would attain to the highest order of intelligences.

If we aspire to the glory of the sanctified, to the presence of God, the holiest of all, the pathway is before us; obedience to the law of the celestial kingdom, to those principles which are pure, holy, just and good; by implicit subjection to the law of God, by following in the footsteps of Jesus Christ, who magnified the law and made it honorable, so that he has left us a perfect example, and is the prototype of all saved beings.

In the quotation which we have made from the law of the Lord, we are told that they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto you, ever the law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom." "For he who is not able to abide a celestial law, cannot abide a celestial glory." And that which breaketh a-law, and abideth not by law: but seeketh to become a law unto itself; cannot be sanctified by law, and must remain filthy still." It is not then, a mere assent to foundation principles, neither is it a transitory and obedience, although a perfect one for the time a being; but a complete and continued subjection to the divine requirements which sanctifis, and frees from sin; makes the law of God the law of our being, secures to us the countenance and favor of the God of Abraham, by a practical acknowledgement of our faith in him; qualifies us for intimate intercourse and fellowship with God by our submission to those principles by which he is himself governed.

It must be evident then to every rational being, that the espousal of any principle not.

# KINGDOM OF DANIEL.

When we look over the history of the past,
from the earliest ages of antiquity down to the
present-hour, we see that nation after nation,
institution after institution, and empire after
empire, have risen, and flourished for a sea-
Bon, and then ceased to exist. Like the me-
teors of the sky they have flashed forth their
light, for a moment upon the world, and sunk
to rise no more. Where is the Assyrian em
pire with her boundless wealth and her count-
less cities? where is Persia, robed in the glo
ry of the sun? where is Egypt, distingushed
for her wisdom, and for her profound knowl
edge of the siences and arts? whereis Greece
once the seat of learningand the cradle of lib
erty? where is Rome, imperial Rome, whose
iron arm once swayed the destinies of the
earth? These nations were once strong, vig
orous, and powerful; they stand out in the his
tory of the world, preeminent and distinguish
ed, but luxury, effeminacy and vice have
breathed upon their flourishing glories, and the
dark passions of the human heart, let loose,
have trampled them in the dust.

The sentence of death seems to have been
passed upon nations as well as upon individ
uals. The decree of the Almighty has gone
forth, and the mightiest empires that ever stood
upon the earth have dwindled 'into insignifi
wanee, and nothing scarcely now remains to
tell us of their ancient granduer and glory,
excepting the record of the past. When we
examine the writing of those, who were in
spired by the spirit of the living God, we learn
that all human governments are destined to be
overthrown, and the fate of every earthly king
dom has long since been sealed by the fiat of
Jehovah. But thanks be to God, there is one
kingdom, "which shall never be distroyed."
What is that kingdom? we answer, it is not a
kingdom to be established by human wisdom,
but one which the God of heaven shall set up,
which shall-break-in-pieces-and-consume-all-at
other kingdoms, and it shall stand forever
and ever. The prophet Daniel, when the vis
ions of heaven were unfolded to his view, to
looked down through the lapse of ages, and
saw the rise and fall of empires, tracing the
grand events which were to occur from the
days of Nebuchadnezzar down to the latest
generation, has described to us that kingdom
so plainly, that it cannot he mistaken.

Daniel vii: 7, 8, "After this I saw in the
night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly;
and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and
break in pieces, and stamped the residue with
the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the
beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
I considered the horns, and behold, there came.
up among them another little horn, before
whom there were three of the first horns
plucked up by the roots; and behold in this
horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a
mouth speaking great things. I beheld till
the thrones were cast down," &c. After he
was told what the four beasts which he saw
were, that they were four kings, in the 19th
verse he says: "Then I would know the truth
of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all
the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
were of iron, and his nails of brass; which de--
voured, break in pieces, and stamped the resi-
due with his feet. And of the ten horns that
were in his head, and of the other which came
up, and before whom three fell; even of that
horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake
very great things, whose look was more stout
than his fellows. I beheld, and the same horn
made war with the saints, and prevailed a-
gainst them." The prophet goes on and says:
"The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
upon earth, which shall be diverse from all
kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth,
and shall tread it down, and break it in
pieces. And the ten horns-out-of-this-kingdom-
are ten kings that shall arise, and another shall
rise after them, and he shallbe diverse from the
first, and he shall subdue three kings." &c.

In the second chapter of Daniel, 31st verse, we
read, "Thou O king sawest, and behold a great
image. This great image, whose brightness
was excellent, stood before thee; and the form
thereof wasterrible. This image's head was of
fine gold, his breast & his arms of silver, his bel
ly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his
feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou saw
est till that a stone was cut out without hands,
which smote the image upon his feet that
were of iron and clay, and brake them to pie
ces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass,
the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces to
gether, and became like the chaff of the sum
mer threshing-floors; and the wind carried
them away, that no place was found for them:
and the stone that smote the image became a
great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
This was the Dream of Nebuchadnezzar who
at that time swayed the sceptre of the world.
It is a point conceded by all who are conver
sant at all with the prophets that there were
to arise, at different periods of the world, four
and universal empires or kingdoms, which were
to be more extensive than any others. But
Daniel explains this matter perfectly. In his
interpretation of the dream he says: "Thou
(or thy kingdom) art this head of gold. Af
ter thee shall arise another kingdom inferior
to thee." This is well known to be the-king
dom established by Cyrus, called the Medo
Persian empire, represented by the breast and
arms of silver which conquered the Babylo-

# TO THE SAINTS, THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD, GREETING:
-DEAR BRETHREN:

It has been some time since I
lifted my pen in the defence of truth, and
for the cause of Zion; not having been situa-
ted where it seemed actually necessary to do
$0. But the time has now arrived, when it is
necessary, not only for myself, but for all the
lovers of the cause of truth and rightousness,
to lift their voices in defence of the glorious
cause which we have espoused, and to sustain
unimpaired, and unsullied, the order which
God has established in his Church and King
dom. Also, to keep his law and statutes and
observe all his commandments to do them, for
if we deviate from these things, and abide no
in the law of God, the Lord has said that we
are none of his.

Now if our Heavenly Father, in his loving
kindness, and great condescension, deigns to
give untous a revelation of his will, and make
known what is necessary to constitute HIS
Church, and points out the station and stand-
ing of every officer and member, in said church;
also, defines their duty and calling to the most
minute particular, declaring at the same time,
that these officers of necessity, must exist in
His Church, has-any man or set of men, the
right to disannul that order, and say, that, be
cause some one or two of the persons who were
appointed to stand as officers in that church,
have died, the offices which they filled are no
longer necessary, but destroyed! Most as-
suredly not.

If that reasoning holds, that the office ceases
at the decease of the holder, then we might
with propriety say that the office of first
President ceased at the death of Adam, as he
was the first to fill that important station in
the Church of God, upon earth; and the au-
thority, (agreeable to the theory acted upon by
the Church at Nauvoo,) rested upon the next
grade of officers, until their death, then upon
the third grade outil they departed this life,
and so on through all the grade's of officers until
there are none reutaining of the original offi
cers, who were appointed at the organization,
when behold, the Church is left without any
one who is authorised to administer to her the
bread of life, for mark this, if a vacancy in
the quorum of the first presidency cannot be
filled, and the quorum be kept perfect, neither
can a vacancy in the quorum of the Twelve be
filled, or the Seventies, or the High Priests,
or Elders, or of any quorum in the Church.-
But this is not the case; vacancies in the
quorum of the first presidency can and have
been filled, it is the head of the body, and
we all know that a body cannot exist long
without a head.

Adam understood this principle perfectly,
insomuch that he ordained men who could step
forth and act in the same capacity after his
death, in which he acted during his life, hold
ing the keys equal with himself they went
forth and ordained others to hold the same
authority, keeping the first office good, above
all others; until finally, the people and church
rejected the order of God, and no doubt, voted.
that they did not want "a Guardian, a Prophet,
or a Spokesman," and probably withdrew their
fellowship from him; when the Lord had re-
spect unto the first president, or prophet, Noah,
but left the people to themselves, to work out
their own destruction, until their cup of iniquity
was full; when he came out in his judgments
upon them and cut-them off for their wicked-
ness, and appointed their place among hypo-
crites, where there was weeping and wailing
and gnashing of teeth: the prophet, however,
and all that would cleave to him, or the order
of heaven, were saved from this awful calami-
we ty, notwithstanding a large majority were
against them. "As it was in the days of
Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming
of the Son of Man."

Can it be presumed for a moment, that God
would organize his church and kingdom by
his own voice, and place in it officers which
he declared were actually necessary; who
were to act in their station, agreeably to the
institution of HEAVEN; and yet a part of those
officers could, soon after, be dispensed with,
and the organization remain perfect? I think
not.

Now dear brethren, you are all, undoubted-
ly, aware of the course pursued by the twelve
and the church at Nauvoo, on this subject;
that they have declared the quorum of the
first presidency vacant, on account of the
