# LETTER TO JAMES M. GREIG.

CONCLUDED.

It does not follow, as a consequence,
that the religion thus corrupted is false
and not the truth of heaven; but the very
reverse. What system was it that the
apostle guarded the saints of his and all
succeeding days against corrupting, as-
suring them that in the last days a cor-
ruption would take place, was it not the
true system of heaven? Surely it was.
Was it not the system of heaven, where
men [monsters] were to avail themselves
of their apostolic and prophetic influence,
and belifted up in the pride of their hearts,
become proud, boasters, inventors of evil
things, truce breakers, incontinent, and
abusers of themselves with mankind?
It was. Was it not those who had a
place among the saints, who were so far
to depart from the fear of God, and the
principles of decency, as to be sufficient
ly daring to put at defiance the laws of
man and the holy principles of the insti-
tutions of heaven, as to enter into houses
and lead astray silly women, laden with
sins?. Need I answer it was. Was it
not the true religion of heaven, which all
sacred writers both of the Old and New
Testament, cautioned the world and all
the saints against corrupting, and corrupt-
ing by certain defined abominations mi-
nutely detailed? All will answer it was.
The conclusion then is, that the true or-
der of God, in the last days, was in dan-
gér, imminent danger of being brought in-
to reproach and shame, by those who
seek to gratify their carnal desires, in de-
fiance of all righteousness, and, with a
bold effrontery, claiming the authority of
the priesthood, that they might more ef-
fectually accomplish their corruptdesign,
and thereby bring the whole church of
God under condemnation before God; and
so far sink it in the estination of all, as
to render it odious in the eyes of the
world. The true church of Christ, ac-
. cording to the testimony of both prophets
and apostles, of -olden time, was in this
danger in the last days. As to societies
which the sacred writers never consider-man in the flesh.
'-ed as of divine origin, they never thought
of guarding the world against corrupting.
Their object, and their only object was to
preserve the institutions and ordinances of
of heaven. from abuse: knowing, as they
did, that an abuse there would sooner or
later prove fatal to the world. What then,
Dear Brother, shall we say? What can
any man say? Why, the society where
those abuses, as defined by the sacred
writers, made their appearance, has sure-
ly a high degree of testimony that it is
the true church of Christ in the last days.
The corruptions which the sacred writers,
of former days, said would make their ap-
pearance in the church of Christ in the
last days, have made their appearance
among us.

Had Paul lived in our days, andlooked
at the church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints, he could not have described
it more minutely: the very corruptions
have made their appearance, that he said
would take place in the Church of Christ
in the last days.

Had not these corruptions appeared
among us, we should have lacked one im.
portant testimony that we were the true
church of Christ; but the appearance of
these corruptions has added a testimony
to those who desire to know the truth,
that the kingdom of heaven is with us in
distinction to all others.

It may well give us boldness in the
faith, and great confidence before God,
We may arise in the strength of truth,
and purge these things out of our midst;
knowing that the Lord will aid us; seeing
we are doing as commanded, to "sepe.
rate ourselves from all such" workers
of iniquity.

By this you and the branch of the
church under your charge, will see that
they have done well, and may take cour-
age, nothing fearing, for the Lord will be
with such to bless them.

It may be, that the saints may not be
apprised of the fact, that the scriptures
have pointed out the very things which
should take place in in the last days, in the
true church of Christ; and that, a short
time before Christ's coming. Let us hear

come to pass, that instead of sweet smell, there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. And her gates shall-lament and mourn; and she, being desolate, shall sit upon the ground. And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, we will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach."

A few remarks on the foregoing quotation, will place the subject, in'a point of light, so clear, that "he that runs may read."

What the prophet here said, he said about the daughters of Zion: "Moreover," the Lord said, "because the daughters of Zion are haughty," &c. All then that he says afterwards, he says about the daughters of Zion, and none others. He says, "they walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go." The representation given of them, is that of pride, haughtiness, and shameful wantonness. In the preceding part of the 3d chapter he gives us a clue to the way they got means to enable them to gratify their corrupt desires. In the 14th verse we have the following remarkable sayings: "The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients, [or elders] of his people, and the princes thereof; for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.. What mean ye, that you beat my people, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord of hosts."

The prophet here charges the ancients or elders of the people, with spoiling the poor, eating up the vineyard, and having the spoil of the poor in their houses. The awful use made of this spoil of the poor, is but too clearly set forth. It was wasted on their lust. In consequence thereof, the daughters of Zion were to walk with stretched-forth necks, and wanton eyes; they were to have the spoil of the poor in their houses, and riot on the labor of others; and to finish their corruption and abomination, seven of them were to lay hold of one man, and say, we will eat our own food, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach.

This is an order of things, which I think has never existed but once, since the spread of Christianity in the world That a collection of females could be got together, capable of such extraordinary conduct must be a matter of astonishment to all; but the prophet said such a thing would take place, and that too, in the Zion of God; and God would enter into judgment with them for it

Let me here remark, that wherever this thing did take place, that society was one the prophet called Zion, or the people of God. No people on earth could go so far into corruption as apostate saints.

Paul said of the Corinthian church in his day, that they had abominations-among them which were not so much as named among the gentiles, that a man should have his father's wife.

Comment on the foregoing would be unnecessary, if all the saints were acquainted with facts as we are. Let all those who are acquainted with Nauvoo, for two years past, just read and think. Let me ask, did not their eyes see the streets paraded by females, haughty and insolent, riding, parading and gallanting, not even to military trainings excepted, until one of the principal officers of the military gave them an open rebuke. Has it not been, and is it not now considered a reproach, by many, not to be united to some man as a wife, though he should have a half a dozen at a time? If it is not so, then they do not believe the doctrine they teach themselves.

When these things are closely examined there is so near a resemblance between the description given of the daughters of Zion by Isaiah, and what has taken place in the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, that the conclusion is forced on the mind, that he, the prophet, had his eye on that church, and actually called that church Zion. But what gives this still greater force, is, that if the things spoken by Isaiah do not transpire in the church of Latter Day Saints, then it is not the Zion of the last days: and their preaching vain, and their faith vain; for these things will take place in the Zion of God, in the last days. But now for the other side of this picture, for Isaiah does not stop here.

In the 4th chapter, 2d verse to the close of the chapter, we have the follow: ing :

"In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion; and he that remain- eth in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem: When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning. And the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glo- ry shall be a defence. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day-time from the heat and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain."

In the the 2d verse, the prophet says, "In that day shall the branch of the Lord bé beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel."

We ask, in what day? Not the day when the daughters of Zion were rioting on the spoils of the poor, walking with stretched-forth necks, and wanton eyes, mincing as they went; when seven of them were laying hold on one man to take away their reproach: that was a day of transgression, when the women ruled over the people of Zion; when the poor were spoiled, the people beaten, and their faces ground. No beauty nor comeliness in that day; but there is a day, notwith- standing all this corruption, when the whole Zion of the Lord, which had been rioting in abominations, and the spoils of the poor, shall be beautiful and glorious? No, gentle reader, no, but the Branch of the Lord that which is escaped of the Israel of God those that fled from these corruptions, and left them who were practising them, this branch shall be- come beautiful and glorious. When will it become beautiful and glorious? When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion? See verse 4th. What filth will the Lord wash away? Their prudery, seven of them clinging to one man, their pride, and their wanton- ness, their rioting on the spoils of the poor. When the Lord is doing this with the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning, the branch of the Lord that has escaped, will be becoming beautiful and glorious.

Here we might indulge ourselves in inquiring into the situation of this branch of the Lord that is to become glorious, Mark, they were those who had escaped -who had fled from the corruptions of the polluted daughters of Zion. This is the branch that is to become glorious. The very fact of their having escaped, supposes that at one time they were in the midst of those who had corrupted their way before the Lord; and under such circumstances, must have much ex- perience, having been acquainted, not only with the things which were accor- ding to the will of God, but also the cor- ruptions and abominations, which caused the Lord to enter into judgment with those who had corrupted their way be- fore him. They had an opportunity of knowing what was, and what was not dis- pleasing to the Lord. They had seen the Zion of God before it was corrupted, the peace, the joy, the union which prevailed, the good will which reigned; and they had seen it after it was corrupted; and could see and feel the change, the great change, which took place after the cor- ruptions complained of by the prophet had crept in, and men and women began to riot on the spoils of the poor, and have stretched-forth necks, and wanton eyes, In all these matters, they were the best judges, and the only competent judges on earth. They had seen prophets lead the people astray, and enter into houses and seduce silly women, laden with sins.

Men may read of these things, and say in their hearts, they are evil, but a mạn who has seen them with his eyes, and heard them with his ears, knows some- thing about them, that no other could know. He is better prepared to guard himself and others against these, and all... other abominations, than those who have never had the same experience could be.

The people who have been made to feel the effect of these corruptions, are prepared to withstand prophet or apostle, who may make such an attempt again. The spirit of those who are thus corrupt- ed, he is able to detect, at first sight, having once seen it manifested, he always knows it afterwards. Thus qualified, and thus prepared, the branch of the

Lord which had escaped was every way is through this branch that all the glory is
qualified to become beautiful and glorious; to come,.
and, if we can credit Isaiah, none others
were, for it was the branch which had
escaped the corruptions he had there de-
scribed, that should become beautiful and
glorious, and after that branch had be-
come beautiful and glorious, the fruit of
the earth was to become excellent and
comely for them.

Let the saints and all others reflect on
this. The whole glory of the world, if
we are authorized to credit Isaiah, which
is to come to pass in the last days, is to
begin with a branch of the Lord, which is
escaped from the corruptions of those
with whom, at one time, they were con-
nected, a people who had so far departed
from all the principles of truth and decen-
cy, as for seven of their women to take
hold on one man and be called by his
name; a people that could riot on the
spoils of the poor, and grind their faces;
and all this under the garb of religion.
If you can find any such a branch as that,
know that it shall be glorious, for the
Lord, by the mouth of Isaiah, hath spo-
ken it. And all those who wish to be
sharers in the glory, let them be parta-
kers with this branch, and they cannot
fail, or the şeriptures fail.

That the things here spoken of by Isa-
iah, were to take place in the last days,
is manifest from what he says in the
_last part of this 4th chapter. It is there
said, after the Lord has purged away the
filth of the daughters of Zion, he will create
upon every dwelling-place of Mount Zion
and upon her assemblies, a cloud and
sınoke by day, and the shining of a flam-
ing fire by night; for upon all the glory
shall be a defence. And there shall be a
tabernacle for a shadow in the day-time
from the heat, and for a place of refuge,
and from a covert from storm and from
rain.

All who are at all acquainted with mat-
ters and things as they now exist, or have
existed, since the days of Isaiah, know
that no such things as the above have exist-
ed since his day, but if his testimony is
true, they are to exist after the Lord has
purged away the filth of the daughters of
Zion, and purged away the blood of Jeru-
salem, by the spirit of burning and the
spirit of judgment. And this purging, and
this burning, is not to take place until after
the branch of the Lord has escaped; for it

Then indeed, in the true Zion of God,
in the last days, there were to be systems
of corruption, wanton women, and disso-
lute men, that were to corrupt themselves
and cause the judgments of God to be re..
vealed against them, and to cause a sep-
aration, and a branch to go forth from them,
which in the end is to become beautiful
and glorious. This the prophet says was
to take place in the Zion of God; and it is
only tu the last days it can take place.

Now, if the church of Jesus Christ of
Matter Day Saints, is aints, is the Zion of God, then
fellow saint and sinner, the whole story of
the spiritual wife system is told; and that
it is the true church of Christ, let the cor-
ruptions of that body speak for themselves.
He that hath eyes may see, and he that hath
ears may hear, and he that has a heart may
understand, for the very corruptions which
Isaiah said should take place among the
daughters of-Zion, have taken place in that
church, not only the corruption, but the
separation also, and all the rest will doubt-
less follow.

Now let me call the attention of all the
saints to the facts already disclosed. We
have seen by the writings of Paul that in
the last days, in the church of Christ, an
apostacy was to take place, that men were
so far to depart from the true faith, and to
be so completely led by seducing spirits,
as to go into houses and lead astray silly
women, laden with sins, and that too, un-
der the sanctity of religion. This thing has
actually taken place in the church of Lat.
ter Day Saints.

Isaiah says that in the Zion of God the
men would become oppressors, and live
on the spoils of the poor, and the women
would become wanton, and seven of them
would take hold on one man, to be called
by his name, the same as to become his
wife. This algo has taken place in Nauvoo.
The Savior said that before his second ad-
vent he should have an evil servant, whom
he had appointed to give meet to his house
in due season, who, instead of so doing,
would go to eating and drinking with the
drunken, and to smiting his fellow servants,
and that he would cut off that servant, in
an hour when he did not look for it. This
also has actually taken place, not only the
eating and drinking with the drunken-
smiting the fellow servants-but the cut-

the mustard stalk, until the fowls of heaven might lodge in the branches thereof, and then, and not till then, could, it leaven the whole lump.

What more need we say then, to let all the saints see the precise situation of the church at present, and what awaits the whole church in futurity. The branch which has escaped after the separation is complete, become beautiful and glorious; and the tares be prepared for the burning.

The corruption's which have spread and are spreading in that apostate and corrup branch of the church at Nauvoo, is one of the strong evidences which go to prove the church of latter day, saints to be the true church of Christ: for in-it are fulfilling the words of the prophets, of the apostles, and of the Savior of the world. All are fulfilling to the letter.

The church has now reached an interesting and important point in prophecy- the period where the holy writers begin to date its prosperity. It had, according to all the sacred writers, to pass a severe scene of trial and affliction, before its prosperity could come. Corruptions must infect the head itself, before it could be prepared to go forth and meet the bridegroom. And the Lord had to show his disapprobation of the corruptions introduced, hy cutting off his evil servant. After that it had to pass the severe trial of separating the wheat and tarès-which is now especially going on before it could tower and spread so that the fowls of heaven could come and lodge in the branches thereof; and like leaven, leaven the whole lump. After all this work of trial, affliction and purification, then comes the time when the separated branch, which has been enabled to pass the ordeal, and neither faint by the way nor get corrupted, to become beautiful and glorious, through the triumph of which, the fruit of the earth was to become excellent and comely. Well then may-the saints lift up their heads and rejoice, seeing the prophecies of both the old and new Testament are fuly ling before their faces, and they, the honored among men, whom the Lord has chosen, that the words of the prophets might not fail, and the testimony of Jesus be fulfilled in the eyes of all living, that all might be left without excuse at his coming. Well may they gird up their loins and prepare for the coming of the bride- groom: for behold he cometh according to his word. The way is preparing, and the day approaching. The things long since

spoken of by all the holy men of old are now passing before our eyes; the mustard seed is planting the leaven is about being put into the meal-the branch is separating, and all things are now making ready.

All opinions about the Savior's coming are vain, unless they are founded on the fulfilment of the ancient prophecies. Every thing there said, preparatory to his coming must be fulfilled, before he comes. It is equally so with regard to the church of Christ in the last days, all things spoken of it by the prophets must be fulfilled. The corruptions which they said should be in. troduced into it must defile it. When Christ said that in the days preparatory to his coming, he would have an evil servant -for so he called him and that he would cut him off at an unexpected hour, this: must take place, or the words of the Savior fail.

So certain then, as ever Christ was to raise up a man in the last days to lay the foundation of a great work, just so certain it was, that that servant would be cut off; for he that said one, said the other. As sure then as ever there was to be any true church in the last days, so sure it was that it would-be corrupted, for the same spirit of prophecy indicted one that did the other; and so certain as the church of Christ in the last days was corrupted and that was as sure as it existed-so sure it was, that part of that corruption was the leading of silly women astray; and so sure as the true church of Christ was to exist in the last days, so sure, by reason of the corruptions in it, it was to divide, and sure as it divided the branch that separated was to become beautiful and glorious.

Why then, if we claim to be the church of Christ in the last days, should the things which have transpired be matters of surprise or fear. The various systems in the world which lay claim to be the latter day work of God, to prepa prepare the way of the Son of man, are all founded on principles at war with the prophecies, and in op position to them; the work of God C in the last days was to be a work through which all the prophecies, which had pre- ceded the time of its commencement in the world, that had not been fulfilled, should be fulfilled. We then have this claim to be the true church of Christ, that the prophecies are now fulfilling in our midst, that the very things the Savior, prophets and apostles, said should take place in the last days, are taking place with us, and no

where else. What higher evidence then,
that we are indeed the church of Christ in
truth? If this is not giving to the world
the testimony that we are the truc-church,
I know not what could do it.

The saints then have but one thing to do
in relation to these abusers of themselves
with mankind, that is, turn away from theni
and be separate, and touch not this unclean
thing, but let those be clean who bear the
vessels ofthe Lord. Separate, ye saints of
the most high, from this sink of corruption,
that the branch of the Lord may be glori-
ous: for it is the separated branch that
shall become-beautiful and glorious, and
through whom the Lord will bring peace
to the earth, and though the separated
branch should, at first, be among the so-
cieties of the world as a grain of mustard
among seeds, vet, it shall grow and tower
until the fowls of heaven come and lodge
in the branches thereof; or though it
should be in comparison as the leaven
which is put into the meal, with the meal
itself, yet, it will not cease until it has

SIDNEY RIGDON.

To the Members of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints.

BRETHREN BELOVED: The time has come,
in the dispensations of the Most High to the
Saints of the last days, when it becomes abso-
lutely necessary for every man, for every wo-
man, for every individual who essays to be
saved in the kingdom of God, to set their feet
afresh upon the rock, of which the Saviour has
emphatically declared; "the gates of hell shall
never prevail against it,"

The time has fully come, in the history of
the Church of the living God, established for
the last time, when it is made a sacred and par
amount duty, for every individual who would
maintain the integrity of the Covenant which
he has entered into with God, to lift up the voice
as with the sound of a trumpet-to cry aloud
and spare nor

A heaven-daring apostacy-an ulter and en-
tire departure from the principles of eternal life,
as they are revealed to us in the Bible, Book of
Mornman, and Book of Covenants, has occurred
in our midst; and it remains with us individu-
ally to determine, whether we shall take part
with God and righteousness, truth and virtue,
or, turn again to the weak and beggarly ele-
ments of sin, and thereby forfeit all claim, right,

title, interest or promise, to the glorious rest of
God, and the ultimate beatitude of the celes-
tial kingdom. Nothing less than this is the issue
which now presents itself for our deliberate and
solenin determination.

In discussing a subject of such transcendant
import, it behoves us to use great plainness of
speech, and to distinctly keep in view the so-
lemnities of the eternal judgment.

It will not be disputed, that the church of
Christ is eminently a system of order, and hap-
pily we all recognise the precise means by
which we shall determine in what that organiza-
tion consists an appeal to the doctrine and
Covenants of the Church, as made known by
revelation of which the Lord has declared in his
preface to the Book of Commandments" "Be-
hold I am God and have spoken it, these com-
mandments are of me, and were given unto my
servants in their weakness, after the manner of
their language, that they might come to under-
standing, and inasmuch as they erred, it might
be made known, and inasmuch as they sought
wisdom, they might be instructed, and inasmuch
as they sinned, they might be chastened; that
they might repent; and inasinuch as they were
humble, they might be made strong, and bless-
ed from on high, and receive knowledge from
time to time." Sect. 1.

We are perfectly safe then in concluding that
a departure to the right or left, from the things
written in that Book, is an apostacy from the
truth of God, a departure from the order of
Heaven, for we are expressly told to search
these commandments, for they are true and faith-
ful, and the prophecies and promises which are
in them shall all be fulfilled.

To this end therefore were they given "that
man should not counsel his fellow-man, neither
trust in the arm of flesh, but that every man
might speak in the name of God, the Lord, even
the Savior of the world."

To the law and the testimony then, if they
speak not according to that. it is because there is
no truth in them.

The first. point which demands, our serious
consideration, is the channel of communication.
between God and the Church; if the Lord God
has ordained by immutable counsel and decree,
a certain fixed order, through which he speaks
to the Church, it must be all important that we
make no mistake here, or of necessity that we
cut off all communication with the heavens, and
cease to be in connexion therewith as the body
of Christ. What says the law? "And again
the duty of the president of the office of the
high priesthood is to preside over the whole

church, and to-be like unto Moses. Behold here is wisdom, yea to be a seer, a revelator, a translator and a prophet, having all the gifts of God, which he bestow's upon the head of the Church." Here, then, the matter is put clearly, definitely, and forever at rest. The president of the high priesthood, that is the presiding pre sident of the three first presidents of the Church, is the legal organ of communication to the Church, and no other. Que. If the Church should cut off the head, and place the hand or foot at the head, would God ever speak to them through those members? Most assuredly not. He would laugh them to scorn, and damn them for their pains. Whose prerogative then is it to place this head to the Church? God's alone. The presiding triune must be pointed out by the voice of the Almighty.

We are prepared then to enter upon the ex- amination of those thrilling events, which have absorbed our attention for some time, and by a 'rigid adherence to the word of him who cannot lie, we shall be able to arrive at a correct un- derstanding of the whole matter. Who then is that individual who sustains the important rela- tion of revelator to the Church, for he alone is competant to a reorganization of the presidency, for without that organization we have not the or- der of God, and consequently never can triumph gloriously.

Fortunately, most providentially, this matter is stripped of all ambiguity, and is made clear as a sunbeam to the believer in the revelations of Jesus Christ.

Sidney Rigdon is the only man, who has been pointed out again and again, by the voice of Is- rael's God, as sustaining that relation-hear him: Sect. 84, part 5. "And now verily I say unto you, (Joseph Smith, and Sidney Rigdon,) I give unto you a commandment, that you continue in the ministry and Presidency, and when you have finish- ed the translation of the prophets, you shall from henceforth preside over the affairs of the church and the school; and from time to time as shall be manifested by the comforter, receive reve- lations to unfold the mysteries of the kingdom, and set in order the churches, and study-and-learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues and people. And this shall be your buisness and mission in all your lives, to pre- side in council and set in order all the affairs of this church and kingdom."

If this is the word of God in very deed, then is Sidney Rigdon, beyond all cavil or dispute the called of God, to preside over his Church, and Kingdom and the lawful revelator to the same. Suppose I disown and disavow him as a revela

tor, will that frustrate the purposes of God. Suppose any number or individuals should do the same thing will that thwart the designs of Jeho- vah? Verily nay.

The question for us to determine then, is, not whether the Twelve, the Fifty, or the Seventy have rejected Elder Rigdon, but whether the great God has rejected hum.

Happily this question is capable also of an ea- sy solution, by a; thus saith the Lord;"

"I have sent forth the fullness of my gospel, by the hand of my servant Joseph: and in weak- ness have I blessed him, and I have given unto bim the keys of the mystery of those things which have been sealed, even things which were from the foundation of the world, and the things which shall come, from this time until the time of my coming, if he abide in me, and if not, an other will I plant in his stead."

According to this declaration of the Lord, Jo- seph Smith was to stand in the office in which he was then placed, until the coming of the Son of Man, unless he transgressed, when the Lord de- clares he would plantanother in his stead; again, this other was to be appointed by Joseph himself, "If he shall transgress he shall have no power except to appoint anotnerin Iris stead."

Where then is the man called of God by rev elation, and ordained by. Joseph Smith, as a prophet, seer, and revelator for the church? Sidney Rigdon, and Sidney Rigdon alone.

The conclusion is therefore inevitable, that Peither the word of God has failed, or Sidney Rigdon is planted by God himself in the stead of Joseph Smith. Let God be true, if all men should be found liars. Why then was Sidney Rigdon rejected by the Twelve, and all their ad- herents, and an order of things instituted ndi- rect violation of the order of God?

The answer is plain, because they have lost the light of the spirit of God, and are involved in Egyptian darkness; "if the light that is in you become darkness, how great is that darkness."

It now becomes necessary to touch upon an other fact which affords us a key, by which we may unriddle the whole mystery of this extraor dinary conditioy condition of things.

There has been taught in the church a doc- trine, which to a man with the revelations of God in his hand may be deemed the most daring and damning that could be imagined to exist among any people, because it is the prolific parent of every vice, and the whole catalogue of crime, follows in its frain as naturally and necessarily as water will find its level. Need I say I allude to the spiritual wife system; to cover up this sys- tem, lying was taught to be justifiable, and a ser

the dominant party in Nauvoo, we do say they
have carried their measures by mob law, they have
not regarded the statutes of heaven, they have
essayed to cut off from the church multitudes, to
whom they would grant no opportunity of trial
and defer.ce, they have trampled under foot the
free expression of opinion and the laws of the land,
and are, therefore, if any acts can define then, both
tyrants and mobocrats.

In view of all these abominations, you may be
ready to ask, is not your confidence lessened in the
truth of the work of God of the last days in the
Bible, Book of Mormon, and Book of Covenants?
Not in the least, I know these things for myself,
and that the purposes of the Almighty, as foretold.by
the Prophets, the Savior and the Apostles, will
all be fulfilled, and I have this additional testimony,
having been eye and ear witness to the truth of a
chain of prophecies, from Isaiah to John the Rev
elator, regarding the work of God of the last
days.

I, therefore, in the name of my Lord and master,
Jesus Christ, whose unworthy servant I am, call
upon all those, who love him in sincerity and
truth, and who are willing to exhibit their love in
the only way by which it can be known, that is,
by keeping his commandments; to give heed to
that servant whom the Lord has planted in the
stead of Joseph Smith, and turn away from those
who teach and practice doctrines contrary to the
law and the holy commandments delivered unto
us.

## The Gospel as proclaimed by the
Apostles with the attendant circumstan-
ces. The gospel.comes to the world, not
only in its origin, but in all its parts, as
the scheme of heaven, and all its advo-
cates claim for it the right of Divine au-
thority; from its first promulgators
through all successive ages to the pre-
sent. All believers in it disclaim all
right of interference with it, other than
believe and obey it. No right at to alter
or amend, add or diminish and all at-
tempts of the kind are received with ab-
horrence by all believers of every sect
whatever, let the facts of the case be as
they may, whether it is altered or not, all
equally disclaim the right of so doing.
In doing with the gospel by the consent
of all, we have to do entirely with reve-
lation whatever is written on the subject,
by the consent of inspiration, is the only
source to which we can safely go for in-
formation in relation to it, or any part of
it. It is then, of the first importance,
that we let the inspired writers give their
own account of the matter, from first to
last; and all that left for us, is to judge
for ourselves, whether, in the course of
human events, we have adhered closely
to its doctrines and precepts, or whether
we have departed from them.

The sacred writers claim for it the on-
ly power to save men. All other schemes,
it matters not how specious or how fas-
cinating, are in the matters of salvation
unavailing, and have no power unto sal-
vation. Salvation comes alone by the
gospel, and by nothing else. He who
does not embrace it must be damned; let
his character be what it may, from a de-
vout Cornelius to a persecuting Cæsar;
for "he that believeth not shall be dam-
ned;" are the words of its divine author
himself, after he had risen from the dead,
and claimed all power in heaven and
on earth. Not only was it heaven's plan
for saving individuals, but it was the only
means by which the world could be saved
from destruction; for the divine author
said, after his ascension, he would come
again "in flaming fire, taking vengeance
on them that know not God, and obey
not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2d Thessalonians, Ist chapter and 8th
verse. God has therefore ordained the
gospel as the way of acceptance with,
and the rule of obedience to Jesus Christ;
without receiving its doctrines, and obey-
ing its precepts, no acceptance with, no
reverence to Christ is acknowledged.
The mandate which has gone forth from
of old to the kings and judges of the
earth, is to be wise and to be instructed,
and to serve the Lord with fear, and re-
joice with trembling. To kiss the Son
lest he be angry, and you perish from the
way, when his wrath is but a little kindled.
And he says, "Blessed are all they [the
kings and judges] that put their trust
in Irim." 2d Psalm, 10, 11, 12, verses..
If the kings and judges of the earth are
ever blessed it must be by obeying. Jesus
Christ, and if they ever obey him; they
must do it by receiving the gospel, and
obeying all its precepts, for without this,
if we credit the plain declarations of
of scripture, there is no obedience on the
part of heaven a acknowledged, and no
blessing promised.

# THE LATTER DAY SAINTS

the right hand of fellowship that he
should go to the gentiles.

The circumstances under which the
gospel was proclaimed, were very pecu-
liar. The Jews, to whom it was at first
proclaimed, were in the greatest igno-
rance of it; they did not know that there
was any Holy Ghost, see Acts of the
Apostles, 19th chapter, 2d verse. Though
the Jews here spoken of, dwelt at Eph-
esus, it may be fairly inferred that this
was the condition of all the Jews at the
time the gospel was preached to them by
Peter. They did not know that there
was any Holy Ghost That is, they did
not know that there was any Holy Ghost
given in those days, they doubtless knew
that the Holy Ghost had formerly in-
spired their prophets, both to reveal the
things of God as well as to work mira-
cles, but it had long since ceased and
they knew not now that there was any
such thing given.

There had many centuries passed away
that there were no true prophets in Isra-
el, some six hundred years since the voice
of a true prophet had been heard in the
once favored land of the Lord. During
this long reign of silence, the Jews had
made shipwreck of the order of heaven
established among them by the special
revelation of heaven, and had departed so
far from the living God, at the time the
gospel was proclaimed by the apostles,
as not to know that the Holy Ghost was
given or to be given any more.

It was during this long period of the
absence of the voice of the Lord among
them, that they so corrupted their way,
and had sunk into such ignorance, as not
to understand the voice of the prophets,
which was read every sabbath day in
their synagogues. In consequence of
this apostacy, Israel became completely
blinded. They did not know the voice
of the Lord when they heard it. When
a true prophet was sent they rejected
him, and when their Messiah came, they
crucified him, away with him, away with
him, it is not meet that such a fellow
should live, was their cry. Not that they
did not believe in the coming of a Mes-
siah, this they believed with all their
heart; but this Jesus was not he: for want
of the spirit of inspiration, which had
long since been withdrawn, their sacred
books were a dead letter to them. They
could read them but not understand them.

There was to be a Messiah, but they
could not tell when he came, they could
not distinguish him from an impostor,
and why this darkness? Because the
spirit of revelation had departed from
them. They had eyes, but could not
see, cars but could not hear, hearts but
could notunderstand; and why? Because
the spirit of inspiration had departed
from them. They groped for the wall,
as if they liad no eyes. Isaiah 59th chap-
ter; 10th verse. Why happened all this
blindness to fsrael? Because the spirit of
revelation had departed. They went Back,
they stumbled, they fell, becanse there was
no vision: the prophets were no more the
the voice of inspiration, they would not
hear. Their talk was made a snare and a
trap unto them, and they finally fell, and
were scattered, and remain so to this day,
and will remain so "until they shall say,
blessed is he that cometh in the name of
the Lord." No art of man can redeem
theim, no human power can raise them up
the voice of a prophet, the language of in-
spiration alone, can bring them back, or
else they lay forever.

Had they not rejected the prophets, and
said, we have revelation enough, they
would have been in glory to this day; but
instead of this, they are as a wild bull in
a net, not knowing that there is any Holy
Ghost given, believing that the day of rev-
elation is over, forever over.

The blindness which had happened to
Israel, and the cause of that blindness, is so
clearly set forth that all who read may see
and understand it. Such was their con-
dition when the gospel was first preached
unto them, and the apostles well knew that
nothing but the proclamation which they
made could remove their blindness, or en
lighten the gentiles; for through that alone,
the spirit of revelation would or could re-
turn to the world.

The description given of the gentiles,
shews that they were equally destitute of
the true knowledge of God. Paul says of
them, in his day, that they were aliens
from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers to the covenants of promise, hav-
ing no hope, and without God in the world.
Ephesians, 2d chapter, 12th verse.

Such was the condition of Jews and
Gentiles, when the apostles first went forth
to preach the gospel. All the light and
knowledge there was in the world were
the Jewish scriptures, of the, so called, Old
Testament. All beside that was darkness

AFFAIRS AT NAUVO0.

"Our advices from Nauvoo, are to the 20th of Oc-
tober. Brigham Young, one of the Twelve, had,
at a meeting at Ramus, in Hancock county, dis-
coursed thus, in a public address: "That there
were a multitude of spirits, innumerable, who were
flocking about the houses of ill fame, seeking for
bodies, although they were illegally obtained, yet
they were anxious to get them in any way; but
God has devised a plan by which they can now ob-
tain them in a legal way, without disgrace." Im-
portant information, surely. Since the delivery of
the above message, the gentleman and his co.
worker, Heber C. Kimball, have been absent, no
reason assigned: they have gone probably to the
places where their business demands.

We have seen a No of the 'Prophet,' published
in N. York City, containing a letter over the
signature of Wilford Woodruff, declaring, among
other false assertions, that while we were at Nau-
voo 'in' Sept., we threaned to bring a mob on the
place. This is a fabrication without the least foun-
dation in truth. We never said so, nor thought
of saying so; indeed we knew too much about
the light in which the God of Heaven viewed Nau-
voo and the people thereof, to feel any disposition
to bring on them any evil, greater than that de-
creed by the great God. Do these men think, by
publishing falsehoods against us or any others,
that they will avert the judgment of God? If
they do, they will find that God is not to be thus
trifled with. These efforts, of-desperation, will
avail them nothing. They have trified with Je-
hovah; they have set at naught his revealed will:
they have done despite to the spirit of Grace;
and do they think, that by publishing falsehoods
they can deceive the Almighty? It would seem
as if they thought so. Vain men, let them know

Know, reader, that He who rules in the heavens,
has declared the fate of Nauvoo; and all shall see
his hand on Nauvoo for destruction, and not for
salvation: for Nauvoo, on account of the iniquities
of her people, will be desolated; The saints there
have polluted their inheritances, and God will cast
them down, and make them an ensample to all
those who come after them; and all the efforts of
man to the contrary will not save her.

It is not our intention, in the future numbers of
our paper, to devote very little of them to thesel
local matters, but to a very different object-to the
setting forth of the doctrines of the revelations of
heaven. We will leave Nauvoo, and those of her
inhabitants who have corrupted their way befere
the Lord, to their fate; assuring them 'that an
overthrow awaits them, and no earthly power can
save them.

The ignorant corrupters at Nauvoo are busily
engaged, up to the last dates, in spinning out the
history of their own ignorance and shame, in an
unceasing effort to do something to hide their se-
cret doctrine from the public gaze. Do they think
such fooling will any longer hide, from the world,
their system of polygamy? If they do they will
find their mistake by and by.

When these creatures begin to spin out their
shame, they always spin out a long yarn, as they
always have a large stock of the raw material on
hand, and it only requires a little manufacturing
to prepare it for public use.

As to what they say of ourselves, we can say
to them as Sterne said to the Jackass, "we will...
have no quarrel with any of your family." We
have, and always shall consider it an honor to be
opposed by men who know that their own secret
works of darkness are such as to need conceal-
ment to avoid fearful consequences,

Ed.

We wish our friends, and the friends of truth
and virtue, who desire to patronize us, in our de-
termination to sustain the order of heaven in its
organization and purity; to make their purposes
known, as we shall be unable to transmit this pa-
per to any but actual subscribers.

# To the Editor of the Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate.
MR. EDITOR: I would like to say one word, in relation to an assertion made by Wilford Woodruff, (one of the Twelve.) in a communication to the New York Prophet, dated Salem Mass., October 11th, 1844. He there states to the public that Elder Rigdon threatened to turn traitor, publish against the church in the public journals, "intimating," he says, "that he would bring a mob npon the church, stir up the world against the saints, and bring distress upon them," &c. I for one, sir, take the liberty to say, that these assertions are every one of them false. However it is, only carrying out a certain resolution of the twelve, confirmed by an oath, "that the influence of Sidney Rigdon should be destroyed, so help me God." Brigham Young's own words. I do further say, that I was in the society of Elder Rigdon a great deal; as much as any other man, together with many other of his friends at Nauvoo, after the death of Joseph and Hy- rüm; and I do certify, that the advice he gave to his followers was. invariably, raise your voice against no man; do violence to nó man, the twelve are God's anointed, they are in his hands; my work is done here, and my desire is to return to Pittsburgh in peace, soliciting none to follow him, but at the same time rejecting none,
What he did state was, "that he should deem it his duty to give a faithful history of the transactions of the secret chambers, and the works of darkness."

# PROSPECTUS,
FOR,
The Latter Day Saints'
MESSSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

A's much doubt still remains on the public mind as to the true doctrine of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the subscriber proposes to publish a paper in the city of Pittsburgh, for the purpose of relieving the public from all dubie'y in relation to the acknowledged and received doctrines of said church. The paper to be entitled as above.

It will be the primary object of the editor to give a full and clear development of all the doctrines of said church, carefully distinguishing between the true religious belief of said church, and the strange doctrines which have crept in un- awares, and are maintained by some who would fain make the public believe that they are the only legitimate authorities of the church, whose claims shall be examined and exposed to the condemnation to which they are devoted by the Doctrines and Covenants which have been received and on which the church was... formed and organized.

In resuscitating the Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate, it is the intention of the subscriber to contend for the same doctrines, order of church government, and discipline, maintained by that paper-when first published in Kirtland, Ohio.

It is to the public the subscriber must look for patronage to enable him to carry

MR. EDITOR:
Permit me to call your attention to a certain doctrine taught by the apostates at Nauvoo, that Joseph Smith is as much aSaviour to this generation as Jesus Christ was to the generation in which he lived. Heber Kimball declared, in a public address, on the stand, that "Joseph Smith was his Savior." Are not these the very characters whom Paul and Peter saw should be in the church of God, in the last days; who would count the blood of the covenant wherewith they were sanctified an unholy thing; and even deny the Lord that bought them.
