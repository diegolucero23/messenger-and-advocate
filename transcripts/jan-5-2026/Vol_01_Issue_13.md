# ESSAY ON FUTURE EVENTS.
## No. II.
In view of John's mission, it was said than
"the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater
than he." We look at this just as it is said.
that the least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than John, and if there are those who
are less than John, it is because they are not
in the kingdom of heaven, but some other in
Stitution or order of things. The declaration
is a positive one, and it is either true or false,
From what we have previously written on
the kingdom, and doubtless the kingdom here
alluded to, we are prepared to examine the
subject of the standing before God of those
who are in the kingdom of heaven. We have
previously shown that the kingdom was to be
introduced and established through and by a
heavenly messenger, who was to visit the
earth after John the apostle, wrote the revela-
tions, who was to bring to the earth the ever-
lasting glad tidings, something which had not
been announced before; for though there had
been glad tidings proclaimed before, yet, the
everlasting glad tidings had not been pro-
claimed before. From what is said in the 3d
of Malichi and Ist verse, there was to be a
messenger inspired that was to obtain a stand
ing before God, different from all that had
gone before. "Behold, I send my messenger.
and he shall prepafe the way before me: and
the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come
to his temple, even the messenger of the cov-
enant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall
come, saith the Lord of hosts." Here the
Lord is to send a messenger, who is to pre
pare the way before hin, [the Lord.] This
was never said of John the Baptist; it was
said of him that he was to be a messenger sent
of the Lord before the face of the Jews, and
to prepare their way before them; but of this
one it is said, he shall prepare the way before
the Lord, and what follows shews that this
messenger was neither John the Baptist, nor
any or either of the apostles; for soon after
the appearance of this messenger, the Lord
was to come suddenly to his temple, and it is
confirmed by a "behold he shall come" so
that there is to be no misgiving in the case,
"he shall come," and when he comes he is to
be as a refiner's fire and fuller's soap, and
shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and
shalt purify the sons of Levi, and purge thein
as gold and silver, that they may offer unto
the Lord an offering in righteousness." Ser
2nd and 3d verses. "But who may abide the
day of his coming? and who shall stand when
he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire,
and like fuller's soap! And he shall sit as a
refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall pu-
rify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold
and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord
an effering in righteousness."
None of these things have taken place yet,
and John the Baptist and all the apostles are
gone long since. No doubt, then, ought to
remain as to the fact, that the messenger here
spoken of, was none of those former messen-
gers; but one that was to come and prepare
the way before the Lord, preceeding the com-
ing of the Lord to his temple, when he would
purge the sons of Levi. Paul has some say-
ings in the 11th chapter to the Romans, which
seem to allude to the same messsenger. Sed
25. 26 and 27th verses. "For I would not,
brethren, that ye be ignorant of this mystery,
(lest ye should be wise in your own conceits)
that blindness in part is happened to Israel,
until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.
And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is writ-
ten, There shall come out of Zion the Deliv-
erer, and shall turn away ung dliness from
Jacob: For this is my covenant unto them,
when I shall take away their sins." Accord-
ing to this, there is, to go out of Zion a deliv-
erer, and he shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob; for Paul says, "it is thus written."-
Where is it written about this deliverer, unless
it be the one spoken of in Malichi, who is to
prepare the way before the Lord? for ungod-
liness must be turned away from Jacob, be-
fore the sons of Levi can be purged.
We think there need be but one mind on
this point, that the messenger spoken of by.
Malichi, and the deliverer spoken of by Paul
means the same person. Certain it is that
the Jews expected some such a messenger
previous to the resurrection of the dead, and
the restoration of all things, and it is equally
as certain that John the Baptist did not do the
work assigned this messenger, neither have
any others ince his day; and if ever the Lord
designed to send such a messenger he has a
work to to yet...
Isaiah speaks of a messenger which seems
also to be the same. In the 11th chapter and
10th verse he says, "And in that day there
shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for
an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gen-
tiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious."
What follows in the 11th verse, the root of
Jesse here spoken of, who is to stand for an
ensign to the people, and to whom the Gen-
tiles are to seek, and whose rest shall be glo-
rious, has also a work to do in relation to the
Jews; for in that day; what day? the day

when the root of Jesse shall have obtained al again into their land that I gave to their fathers."

Here then is a work beyond Moses, John, or the apostles, and one which cannot be done without direct revelation from heaven, no more than those former messengers could do theirs, and who will say this work is done- none dare say it; and if it is not done then Malichi's messenger, Paul's deliverer, and Isaiah's root of Jesse has yet to do his work, for the gathering, redemption, and purifying of Israel, for none other can do it; and if he does it not the prophecies all fail. In the 16th verse the Lord says, "Behold, I will send for many fisters, and they shall fish them; and afterwards, will I send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks." Now Moses could not bring them out of the land of Egypt, without revelations, John could not prepare their way before them without being more than a prophet, and the apostles could not build the church of Christ without special revelations for that purpose, and how can this messenger, and the fishers and hunters, do all this mighty work without direct revelation. Weil hath Jesus said the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John. There is not a fisher or hunter in the kingdom of heaven but must be greater than John, or else the work assigned them can never be done; for all know John could not do these things.

Jesus said Elias must first come, and restore all things. Why is it said "first come," that is, he must come before something else can come, and what is that something else? from the connection in Luke, as before quoted, it was the resurrection of the dead. This was the doctrine the scribes had taught, that before the resurrection of the dead Elias must come, and the Savior said it was true. The question is who is this Elias? It is admitted that John was the Jews' Flias; but the Savior says they did to him as they listed, and all things was not restored, and yet that must be done or the resurrection of the dead will not come, for Elias must first come. The saying of Malachi is here. to the point, as above quoted, "Behold I send my messenger land he shall prepare the way before me:" how prepare the way before the Lord: there is but one way to do it, viz. to restore all things; and to do this, the least in the kingdom, through and by which this is done, must be greater than John. We have now a wide field before us, the work asigned these last day messengers, is every where written in both the old and new Testaments.

Isaiah in the 1st chapter of his prophecy 25th, 26th, and 27th verses says this concerning Israel, "And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin: And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be cal-

Surely all these things mean something, and if they mean what they say, there is no difficulty about them fo Malichi's messenger 18 to prepare the war before the Lord, that the sons of Levi masne purified; Paul's deliverer is to turn ungodliness away from Jacob, and Isaiah's root of Jesse is to come forth for the gathering and redeeming of Israel, which in amount is te same work, and must be the same persony and must receive his power and authority by the hand of John's angel who was to came with the everlasting glad tidings; and if not we are left to conjecture how he did or as to get them.

The work to be Ferformed by the messenger here spoken ofis of such a character that no reasonable man can doubt the necessity of revelations in order to do it; this is a fact that will not admit of controversy. Moses could not lead Israel out of Egypt and establish them without revelations. John the Baptist, to be qualified for his mission, had to be more than a prophet. And the apostles could not build the primitive christian church, without revelations direct from heaven. Now all this necessary, and here is a mesesenger spoken of, whose work far surpasses them all, and yet he is to be without the aid of direct revelation from heaven. This we think is supposing too much. Jeremiah says, in the 16th chapter of his prophecy, from the 14th to the 17th verse inclusive, speaking, of what shall take place concerning Israel in the last days. as follows: Therefore behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be said The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but the Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that gave to their fathers: Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountains and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks." According to these sayings, the work of this messenger is to far excell all who have gone before, so much that the work of former messengers shall be forgotten. "It shall no more be said, the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israeling Israel, "And I will turn my hand upon out of the land of Egypt, but the Lord liveth, thee, and purely purge away thy dross and that brought the children of Israel from the take away all thy tin: And I will restore thy Jand of the north, and from all lands whether judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as he had driven them, and I will bring them at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be cal-

will be disposed, as an honorable man would, to recall them.

What he has said in relation to the notice we took of the fire in our paper, which desolated our city, deserves a notice from us. The Lord either did stay the flames or he did not if he did not, then, indeed; the citizens of Pittsburgh must be, in the estimation of heaven, in 'a state of corruption too great to admit of divine interposition in their favor, and surely then our religion could not make them any worse. If 'the Lord did stay the flames, it was because some people sought this deliverance at his hand; for he says concerning his people that he will be sought of them, that his mercies may be bestowed upon them. We consider the citizens of this city are indebted to the great God that our whole city was not laid in ruins; and if our heavenly Father did interpose in our behalf, and stay the flames, he did it by sending heavenly messengers for that purpose, for such has been his manner of dealing from days of old, as will be seen from the following quotations of scripture:

And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. Gen. 19: 15, 16.

And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash, the Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor.--Judges 6: 11, 12.

The heavenly messenger proceeds, in the above instance, to give Gideon instruction how to deliver Israel from the Midianites to whom they were then in bondage. In the process of time, Israel, through transgression, fell into the hands of their enemies, and were sorely afflicted, being in bondage to the Philistines, when the Lord again interposed in their behalf, in his usual way, by sending an angel to Manoah, the father of Sampson, and laying the foundation for another deliverance of Israel, as will be seen in the 13th chapter of Judges.

So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Bar-sheba seventy thousand men. And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, it is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing-place of Araunah the Jebusite, 2nd Samuel 24: 15, 16.

And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, alas, my master! how shall we do? And he answered, fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.-2nd Kings 6: 15-17.

And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. And the Lord sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria.-2nd Chron. 32: 20, 21.

Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, true, O king. He answered and said, lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the son of God.-Daniel 3: 24, 25.

Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.---Daniel 11: 21, 22.

Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him-Matthew 4: 11.

But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, &c.-Acts 5: 19.

And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, arise quickly. And his chains fell off his hands. And the angel said unto him, gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went out and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. Acts 12: 7-9.

And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve. Acts 27: 22, 23.

But to which of the angels said he at any time, sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?-Heb. 1: 13, 14.

And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. Rev. 7: 1.

And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire, &c. Rev. 14 18.

The foregoing are a few of the many instances recorded in Holy Writ, of the interposition of heaven in behalf of the children of men; by sending angels to their deliverance.

# CITY OF NAUVOO, Nov. 4th 1844.
To whom it may concern-Thisis to certify that, our beloved Brother, James Gibson Divine, is hereby called and authorized to go on a mission to the State of New Jersey, and to preside over the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, in the 3d Congressional District of said State, in company with Brother Ezra, T. Benson, who is to take the Presidency of all the church affairs, in said State.-
We, therefore, give unto this our beloved brother this letter of recommendation, as being worthy the fellowship and esteem OF ALL SAINTS. Given under our hand and seal the day and year above written.
Brigham Young, President of the Twelve,
Willard Richards, Clerk.

The Savior said, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word shall be established, he also says, blessed are you, when men shall revile, and shall speak all manner of, evil of you, falsely for my sake, for so persecuted they the Prophets. Now the point I have in view, to reach, in the recommendation given me by P. P. Pratt, is this, he says that Elder Divine has dissented from the church and joined hands with a hand of apostates, at Pittsburgh, who stand in direct connection with Sharp, Col. Williams, the Laws, Fosters, and Higbees: now Parley, you know in your very soul, when you made the above declaration, that you were guilty of trying to palm an imposition upon the SAINTS, and not Elder Divine; and for the information of every honest man, and woman, I would say that the Kingdom of heaven has been organized, in this place, in accordance with the pattern, shown a Br. Rigdon, from the Heavens, designated by revelation, and that organization accepted, by him, who is Lord of lords, and King of kings; but not one of the above named individuals are in the organization, and neither are any of them, members of the Church of Christ, so that you knew, at the time you penned that article, wherein you saw fit to couple my name in common with my brethren, among the above named persons that you were about publishing a tissue of misrepresentations as black as your own heart, and as the major part of your quorum is corrupt. You continue by saying, that it is a peculiar trait in the character of these disenters to practice deception and hypocracy, and to palm themselves upon the branches of the Church, as members of the very Church they are seeking to destroy. Ol Parley; oh, shame where is thy blush: really it would appear that Parley's senses are fast taking leave of him. Pray, sir, how many of my eastern friends, where your humble servant has labored from time to time during the last six years past, can you gull into the belief that when I appear among them I am recommending myself as a member of the Church at Nauvoo? I answer not one; for they know by this time, that I claim to hold no affinity with such men. I therefore wish it to be distinctly

the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom that shall break and consume all these kingdoms, and shall stand forever. See Daniel, 2d chapter and 44th verse: "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not he left to other people, but it shall break in pieces, and consume all these kingdoms, and it'shall stand for ever." "These ten kingdoms according to the best knowledge we can get by tracing the history of the world down to the present day, includes the European or Allied powers. See Daniel, 7th chapter, 11th and 12th verses: "Ibeheld then because of the voice of the day great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time." The eleventh kingdom that grew out of the Roman empire, according to Daniel's vision, was to be destroyed and put out of existence; but the first ten was to have their dominion taken away, but their lives prolonged for a season and time. Notice the 12th verse: "According to Daniel's and John's visions, these ten kingdoms will make war with the Lamb and his company, and be overcome, but their lives will be prolonged for a season and a time, to help the Lamb and his company throw down old Babylon. If the Allied Powers make war with the Lamb, and his called chosen and faithful ones of course, they make war with the Lamb's kingdom which Daniel said should be set up in the days of these kings. Although it should be like a stone cut from the mountain without hands, or like a grain of mustard seed; yet it will prevail and not be prevailed against. This kingdom in order that the Allied Powers can make war with it, must have a location somewhere in its commencement. We ascertain so by a careful perusal of the word of God, that it will commence with the daughters of Zion where the first dominion comes.

AMOS B. TOMLINSON.

PARLEY P. PRATT.

DEAR BRO. BENNETT:-
In the New York Prophet, of March 29th, there is an article published over the signature of the individual whose name stands at the head of this; the article referred to is headed BEWARE OF IMPOSITION! the caution, I confess is a very salutary one, and one with which I am well pleased. I also rejoice, that P. Pratt has been led by the influence of some spirit, to give me so high and exalted a recommendation, for I do assure you, my dear Brother, that I do esteem it a much stronger and better recommendation, than the following which I received from under the hand of B. Young, and W. Richards, on the same day that I took my line of march from that city of corruption.
