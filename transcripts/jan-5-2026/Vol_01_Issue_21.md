# AN ESSAY ON PRIESTHOOD.

BY S. RIGDON.

The subject of the Priesthood is one about which there is so much said, and about which there has been so much written, that we also will take the liberty of saying a few things about it. All religious sects, of this day as well as previous days, in some form or other my claim to the Priesthood of the primitive, so called, christian church, and by virtue of this claim, go forth into the world to build churches, and when they build them, they say they are churches of Christ, built by the authority of heaven, and organized according to the platform laid down in the New Testament.

It is admitted by all that Christ, in order to build his church, did establish a priesthood, and that by that priesthood his church was built, and if the priesthood had not existed, by which his church was built, it could not have been organized. This is so plainly taught, that no one can doubt it; for the apostles were commanded to tarry at Jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high. This indewment, all will agree, was to enable them to found and establish the church of Christ. This being admitted, it follows of necessity, that without an endued Priesthood the church of Christ could not have been organized and established.

All religious denominations, or nearly all, seem to admit this fact, and, accordingly, efforts are made by them to prove that they have the priesthood which Christ instituted, and by which his church was established; and on that principle claim to be the church of Christ. The Catholics and the Episcopalians make the highest claims to priesthood, and therefore claim the honor of being the church of Christ, to the exclusion of others, or at least the Catholics do; and it must be acknowledged by all sects, that if the priesthood is any where in the sectarian world, the Catholics have as high if not higher claims to it than any others. This all will have to acknowledge, taking the course they do to establish their priesthood, by proving a regular succession of ordination from the apostles; for if they can do this, the Catholics can, and if the Catholics cannot, others cannot.

As far as our knowledge extends of these claims to the priesthood they are claimed by all, who do claim them, on the one common principle, of proving an unbroken chain of ordination from the apostles to the present day; supposing, when they have done this, their claims to the true priesthood cannot be doubted.

It is this claim which we are disposed to examine, in the first instance.

Whether their claim is true or false, is no part of our intention to controvert in this essay; but whether the establishing of this fact, suppose the Catholics can prove a regular chain of ordination from the apostles till the present, will prove they have the apostolic priesthood.

In order to reach the subject fairly, we will present it as it is, founded on this claim. There can be no proof of the fact, from a continuous chain of ordination, only on the principle that the ordination gives the priesthood contended for; for if any other qualifications fare required but the ordination, or in addition to this claim of the priesthood by ordination, the claim by ordination is given up. Now as to this claim as set up by the Catholics, we have a few things to say. If ordination gives the priesthood, then all societies which can prove a regular succession of ordination from the apostles have the same claims to the priesthood the Catholices have, and if ordination gives it to the Catholics, it gives it equally to others, and from this there is no escape; for if the Catholics attempt to deny this priesthood to others, they give up their own claims, by denying that ordination does bestow the priesthood, for if it does in one case, it will in all cases.

That other sects can prove their ordination in regular succession from the apostles, is just as certain as the Catholics can prove theirs, and if none of then can, there is an end to their claim to the priesthood, if it is ordination gives the priesthood. So that the claim which they make of the priesthood, founded on a continuous chain of ordination from the apostles, proves too much, and consequently proves nothing.

The Catholics say that all the Protestant churches are heretics, and not of God, yet, if the Catholic claim to the priesthood is correct, we have this strange and unheard of thing. The true 'priesthood building false and heretical churches, an anomoly sure enough. The same difficulty attends the Protestants claims. They say the Catholic church is "Mystery Babylon the mother of Harlets," and yet, if the Protestant prisethood is the true priesthood, so is the Catholic preisthood: for if the Protestants can prove their claim to priesthood, by virtue of a continuous chain of ordination from the apostles, and thereby lay claim to the priesthood, and by virtue of this claim go forth and build up churches, then indeed, the Catholics have as strong claims to

# Why did not Jesus adopt himself to Cath-

olic notions of getting the priesthood of Peter, and say I will give thee "thy keys of the king-dom," because thou hast been ordained, the reason for this was that ordination did not qualify Peter for the promise; but getting a revelation from God, did entitle him to it; if he were not as guileless as Nathanael. It mattered not how innocent or guileless a man was, this would not qualify him for a promise to that "the keys of the kingdom" should be given to him, he must obtain power with God, and obtain a revelation, before such a promise could be given to him.

# Here we might stop, if we had nothing else

on the subject, and look at the ridiculous pre-tentions of the Catholics to set in Peter's chair; denying the existence of the power by which Peter obtained the promise; for it was only a promise that Peter had obtained, and not "the keys" themselves; and this promise was given from the fact that Peter had got a revelation. Now look, reader, at the Catho-lic priesthood, and what do you see and hear, men claiming to set in Peter's chair, and ex-ercise apostolic authority; and by virtue of being ordained, denying the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and all power of getting revelations; but 'our church is infalable, we have been or-dained according to the rules of our church, and therefore, we are apostles." "Hear Othe heavens, and give ear O earth!!" and not only apostles but have a right to set in Peter's chair; we have been ordained.

# No man can read the history of Peter, and

not be convinced of one fact; that if Peter had not obtained a revelation, he never would have got a promise that he should have the keys of the kingdom;" for his getting the revelation only obtained for him a a promise that he should have "the keys of the kingdom;" but he had to obtain other things beside the revelation, before he could get "the keys," as the history shows.

# The next account we have of Peter, is in

the 17th chapter of Matthew, from the 1st to the close of the 5th verse.

# "And after six days Jesus taketh Peter,

James, and John, his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain, apart, and was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. And, behold, there ap-peared unto them Moses and Elias, talking with him. Then answered-Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: If thou wilt, let us make here three taberna-cles; one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias. While he yet spake, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my be-loved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."

All It this necessary to qualify Peter for his office, man and yet a Catholic can get another Catholic was, to lay his hands on his head, and then all he God, "set in Peter's chair." Can any thing be more impudent and ignorant, than this.

# By examining the principles on which the

apostles claimed their office, this assumption pre-of power by the Catholics, will only appear Peter's more ridiculous. Hear on what principle it was Corinthians 9th chapter, Ist verse. "Am I and not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?". "Am I not an apostle" says Paul, and if Paul be asked what proof had he of his apostleship? what would be the answer? "I have been ordained," no, but I have 'seen Jesus Christour Lord in the flesh."

# Had this not have been the case, all the ordi

nations which could have been given to Paul, or-would not have made him an apostle; but he had "seen Jesus Christ our Lord in the flesh," therefore, he asks "am I not an apostle." Ask one of these modern pretenders to apostlic authority, what proofs have you that you are an apostle;? what would he answer, and or what could it be, if his theory is true that had "Christour Lord" has long since ceased to re-keys "I have been ordained." This is the begin-ning and end of all.

# The apostles never thought of claiming their

office on the ground of having been ordained, only, but on a very different ground, that of divine manifestation made to themselves. In the 15th chapter of this 1st letter to the Cor-inthians, this subject is still confirmed. Paul says this, concerning the appearing of Christ, verse 5, "And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:" This appearing of Christ could not be any of those spoken of before his ascension; for at any of the times mentioned of his appearing before his ascension, there were but eleven apostles. See Mathew 28th chap-ter 16th and 17th verses. Then the eleven dis-ciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted." Mark 16th chapter 14th verse.-

# "Afterward he appeared unto the eleven, as

they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief, and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen." Luke 24th chapter 33, 34, 35, and 36 verses.

are made companions for the devil and his an-
gels, and, in consequence, Satan has power
over them. As long as man is subject to
death so long is he in bondage, and nothing
čan make him free but to obtain a standing be-
fore God beyond the reach of death. Hence
says the Savior "If the Son, therefore, shall
make you free, you shall be free indeed," be
qause he will deliver you from death, and him
who has the power of death, that is the devil,
and having done this, you are no longer in bon-
dage, nor never can again be brought under
bondage.

When a man is dead, he is death's victim,
and remains so until delivered by a resurree-
rection to die no more. It matters not wheth-
er the man is a good man or a bad one, he is
under the power of death, and as long as he is
under the power of death, Satan has power
over him, and will hold his power until a res-
errection from the dead, shall bring him forth
to die no more. At that moment Satan loses
his power, and has no more forever. Hence
it is said "that life and immortallity came to
light by the gospel." That is, the resurrection
from the dead to die no more, came to light by
the gospel, and by this power of the resurrec-
tion, which was in Christ Jesus, the saints are
to be made free indeed.

In accordance with this, we read of "a day
of salvation," "The great and notable day of
the.Lord," "The times of the restitution of
all things," and the most important thing to
be restored is life, life from the dead, to die
no more, to be out of the power of the second
death. We also read of that day" the day
when Paul was to be crowned, and all those
who love the appearing of Christ, of Christ's
coming "without sin unto salvation," of the
dead saints shouting "Allaluia" and of all the
heavens rejoicing.

It was to usher in this day that Christ was
to set up a kingdom in the last days, as spoken
of by Daniel. To prepare men for this day,
came the gospel, not to give them glory and
rest by dying, but by rising again triumphant
over death, to die no more.

This is the cause, ye members of the church
of Christ, in which you are engaged. This
is the glory which awaits your triumph. "See-
ing then you look for such things, what man-
ner of men ought you to be, in all manner of
holy conversation and godliness. Looking to,
and hastening to the coming of the Lord Jesus
Christ, when the world shall be orr fire, and
the elements melt with fervent heat," and the
redemption of the purchased possession roll
in with shouts of victory; each proclaiming
for him or herself "I am alive and live forev-
ermore;" "O death where is thy sting, O
grave where is thy victory."

New York, September 6th 1845.
BROTHER ROBINSON,

DEAR SIR: I now set
down to have a short conversation with you.
We have had the honor of conversing with
president Orson Pratt, who has been sent here
by the twelve first presidents, at Nanvoo, to
preside over the eastern churches in the place
of Parly P. whom they have recalled. Orson
called here yesterday to see Brother Leach,
and on being introduced to me, and told that
I was from Pittsburgh, he asked me if I was
not from Cincinnati, I told him that I was
there last winter, but left in the spring.—
Then you are now from Pittsburgh? Yes sir
How was Mr. Rigdon and his family when
you left? They were well. Do they design
staying in Pittsburgh? They do for the pres-
ent I believe. I understood that they inten-
ded to move to Kirtland? I think not, he was.
there a few weeks ago on a visit, and I heard
some who were not in the church, say that he,
with the church were going to move there, but
I never heard Mr. Rigdon say so. 1 under-
stood that some of his friends at the east, in
Boston. I believe, wanted him to come there
with his family, but I do not think that he will
leave Pittsburgh this winter or before spiring.

Mr. Pratt invited Brother Leach to call and
see him, and said he would like to have a
friendly conversation with him. He asked if
Brother Leach took Mr. Rigdon's paper, and
said he would like to borrow them; Brother
Leach lent him some of the Messengers, and
he left 2 numbers of the N. Y. Messenger,
and said he would like to exchange that way.
He said the was not too bigoted to read Mr.
Rigdon's paper. By this time, they had got
into the friendly conversation that he was
seeking, and they talked nearly if not quite
three hours. He read a part his message,
of which he has published since he came here,
and when he came to that part which reads as

BROTHER ROBINSON.

DEAR SIR:-1 seat myself a few moments at this time, to write to
you, in order to let you know how the work of
our heavenly Father is progressing in my field
of labour in the west. Since 1. last wrote
there has been several added to the different
branches in Iowa and Illinois by baptism, and
many more are believing. I have just return
ed from a tour up the river some fifty miles
distant from this place, where Elder G. M.
Hinkle and myself arrived last Friday in time
to preach in the evening, in the villiage of
Lyons, Clinton Co. I. T. and where we tarri
ed and held meetings daily, in Lyons, and
Fulton city, on the opposite side of the river.
until on Tuesday when I left for home, leav-
ing Elder Hinkle to continue the work in those
places, a few days longer. The people in
these places received us gladly, and treated
us kindly, and with one consent gave heed
unto those things which were spoken by us
in the name of the Lord, The good Lord gave
us of his Holy Spirit, to enable us to make
all things plain to the understanding of the
people, which we declared unto them in the
name of the Lord. The Lord was with us in
very deed, and many were believing when I
left. To day. Elder Harvy Whitlock has
gone to join Elder Hinkle in his labors among
that people a few days. And here let me say
with regard to Elder Whitlock, that he is a
flaming minister of the gospel of the kingdom,
and a worthy member of the same.

Now dear Brother in the kingdom and pa-
tience of Jesus, I want to say to you, that El-
der Hinkle and myself have labored in the
ministry almost daily since I last wrote you,
and we have been blessed of the Lord abun-
dantly in bearing our solemn testimony to the
people, but in consequence of the ill health of
familes, and the want of means, we have been
under the necessity of abandoning our Michi-
gan tour this suminer, though we heartely re
gret, that we were not able to perform that
will, to start in season to preach my way
through to the April conference in Pittsburgh,
Elder Ruby of this place, has preached
some since conference; also Elder Jesse Ad.
ams, Elder Samuel Shortridge, Elder Price,
Elder P. Maskel, and Elders G. W. and R.
Baker have preached a few times. Elder E-
lijah Banta has gone east with President A.
Cowles; he is a faithful young man and de-
sires to know, and do his duty. Elder Harvy
Whitlock will spend the most of his time in
preaching and settling up his business as fast
as possible and prepare to go east. Your pa-
pers are of great service to the saints and other's
in this region. It is very sickly and has been
for some time past in this western country, but
the saints many of them have faith in God to
be healed by the laying on of hands and anoin-
ting with oil in the name of the Lord, as in
days of old, which causes our hearts to rejoice
greatly in the Lord.

There appears to be a spirit of stupidity
manifested among the people to a great extent,
and the saints if they are not very humble and
faithful, are very apt to partake of the same
spirit, but my constant prayer to God is, that
he will pour out of his spirit to wake up sen-
sibility in the hearts of his people, that they
may come up to their high privilege, and work
like saints who are determined in the strength
of Israel's God, that the kingdom now organi-
zed shall roll forth until it brings in the rest of
God. I feel thankful to the Lord for his good-
ness to me and mine; and for the favors be-
stowed on me while in Pittsburgh. May the
Lord bless you and all the saints in the east.
I remain your brother in the kingdom and
patience of Jesus and in hope of the rest of
God at the final triumph of his kingdom.-
My love to all who love and serve our Lord
Jesus Christ.

# POETRY.
## HYMN.
Behold how the Lord
Has girt on his sword;
From conquest to conquest proceeds!
How happy are they,
Who live in this day.
And witness his wonderful deeds.
Hallelujah we sing,
To our Savior and King,
And his praises aloud we'll proclaim,
To the Lamb that was slain,
Hallelujah again,
Sing all heaven and worship his name.
His word he sends forth,
From South to the North;
From East and from West it is heard:
The rebel is charmed;
The foe is disarmed;
No day like this day has appeared.
To Jesus alone,
Who sits on the throne,
Salvation and glory belong:
All hail blessed name,
Forever the same,
Our joy, and the theme of our song.

then the absence of the president and vice president destroys the organization of our government, so then the death of Joseph and Hirum destroy the church organization, and the twelve being in a similar situation to the church, as Congress to this nation, they therefore according to their own argument have no right to rule the church. I have now in as few words as possible, carried out their own argument, which they have frequently preached to the Philadelphia branch of the church, and it commits them in the most preposterous manner, and so long as they hold their present position, proves them to be, as I have said before, an ambitious set of aspirants..

This is not the only instance of the most glaring contradiction in these vicious men, for during the difficulties in the west, previous to Joseph's death, it was many times rumored, that he was murdered. The members of the church becoming alarmed, knowing his life was sought after, would inquire of them, what would become of the church if he were destroyed? and they were answered, that the Lord would, through the Prophet, ordain another to guide the church the same as Moses ordained Joshua, to lead the children of Israel into Palestine, and as Elijah clothed Elisha with divine power, so would another be appointed or clothed. I, and hundreds of others, have heard them teach the same thing from the public stand. Consequently when it was understood that Joseph was actually slain it was reported, and believed by a number that Sidney Rigdon was to be the head of the church, and some said Joseph had a revelation to that effect. Hundreds of times, they taught there was to be a regular succession of Prophets to guide the church, clothed with the mantle of the Holy priesthood, down to the consummation of time, when the Lord was to usher in with the glories of the eternal realm.

This they would tell us was the gospel, but now they deny it, and with unclean hands and base hearts, like satan who wished to "sit in the sides of the north," have exalted themselves to a post, which in my humble opinion none but the most, base abandoned and lawless set of wretches would have the hardihood to do. They would wish to control God, for "I, P. P. Pratt" says they are willing to receive a prophet, when the Lord sends him, that is, if God will send Peter, James or John or Joseph Smith back to the earth, and they can see him ordain a man to that office, they will acknowledge him, but they will not have a man sent in the Lord's way, hence they acknowledge a prophet is wanting. Here again they defeat themselves by their own words, and proving that they are conscious they are acting contrary to the will of God. So I might follow them up in their arguments but I will let this suffice. In the meanwhile I have the honor to subscribe myself
