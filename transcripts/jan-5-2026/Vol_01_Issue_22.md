# TREATIES ON THE CALAMITIES OF THE LAST DAYS.
### BY S. RIGDON.

To those who take the bible for their teacher, in matters pertaining to the future; the present aspect of the world is as portentous as it well could be. We have no account of there being, at any period of the world's history, so general a display of the displeasure of the Lord, in the same way, as is now passing in the world, throughout the length and breadth of the land. From China to Mexico, there is naught but calamities and judgments prevailing. Earthquakes, pestilence, drougth, civil commotions, and fear and confusion reigning. Fires laying waste towns, villiages, cities, and destroying large tracts of country, in a manner before unknown. We ask as did Isaiah "Is there an evil in the city, and the Lord has not done it?" Those who have read the bible, with attention, and placed confidence in what it said, have been expecting such things, and yearly expecting their arrival, and he can now look and say behold they have come.

John the revelator told the world, seventeen hundred years ago, that at a certain time-it would be announced by an angel, that the hour of God's judgment has come, and that it would be required of men to "fear God and worship him." See Revelations 14th chapter 6th and 7th verses, "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of water." It was this annunciation, that was to prepare the way for the downfall of Babylon, and for the resurrection of the dead, and the final triumph of the heavens; as will be seen by comparing the quotation above with the 8 verse "And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication." As also with the 18th chapter of Revelation 1st and 2d verses, "And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean bird." And 19th chapter 1-3 verses "And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia, salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said, Alleluia, and her smoke rose up for ever and ever."

From the above we learn that Babylon was not to fall until an angel had announced it, and that was to be after an angel had brought the everlasting gospel, at which time the hour of God's judgment was to commence. By this we learn that there was a particular period to arrive, which was called the hour of judgments. No subject is more plainly taught, by all the sacred writers, and none upon which there is more said, than that of the judgments of the last days, and as sure as there is truth in either the old or new Testament, there is a day or rather an hour, as John calls it, of judgment, which is called so by way of preeminence, awaiting the world; and one that is not far distant, that will convulse the nations of the world, We are disposed to say a few things about this period, and the relation the present sectarian world bears to it. According to the present condition of the religious world, this day cannot come without laying waste the entire sectarian world. That the destruction of this day, is the result of having corrupted and rejected the true religion of heaven, the scriptures abundantly teach. In the 24th chapter of Isaiah, where we have an account of the effects of this hour of judgment in detail, the reason for it is plainly declared. See the 5th verse, "The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, broken the everlasting covenant." The earth is utterly to be laid waste, because it "is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;" and if it be asked how it was that the inhabitants had defiledit, the answer is given in the last part of the verse; "because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, broken the everlasting covenant." Who has done this? the religious world; for they it were who had the laws and ordinances in trust and to whom the everlasting covenant is given. The heathen world had not the laws, ordinances nor covenant, that they could transgress, change or break. If the earth then is to be utterly laid waste, because the laws of heaven are transgressed. the ordinances changed, and the everlasting covenant broken, it is the religious world that

# MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE.

PITTSBURGH, PA.

Presidents S. Rigdon and S. James together with Elders James Blakeslee and J. M. Cole have left for Philadelphia, to be in attendance at the conference on the 6th inst.

May the Lord go with them, and his spirit attend all their assemblings together, and much good be the result of this conference, is our sincire desire.

In this No. will be found some extracts giving a condensed account of the great difficulties in the west, which we notice for the satisfaction of our readers who do not obtain the regular news of the day. We give them as they came to us in the various papers froin which we make the extracts. We should have given more copious extracts from the Nauvoo papers, had the editors been disposed to have exchanged with us, but as they do not we are compelled to look to other sources for news on this painful subject.

## TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS.

To our subscribers who have not paid their subscription, (of whom we regret to say there are several,) we would just remark, that it would be a matter of great accommodation to us, if they will be so kind as to remit us their small dues soon, as we are under the necessity of making arrangements for winter, which is fast hastening upon us also we have some few debts to pay which must be canceled without fail: therefore, it would be very gratifying for our friends to send us that which justly belongs to us, which if they should do would greatly relieve us, and save us much anxiety. When you sit down to envelop $1 to send us for this volume, which by the by, is decidedly too small a sum, you may take a little pains and inclose another dollar for the 2d vol. that is, if you should wish to take it, as it will save you postage of another letter soon; as we have come to the conclusion not to send the 2d volume to any except the pay is received in advance, that being decidedly the safest, best, and most satisfactory way of conducting the business of a paper. And the satisfaction of reading a paper which is paid for is so extremely gratifying, that we sometinies marvel that any person can be found, who will deprive themselves of such a laxury.

no communication with them as he did with those whom his own messengers adopted.- A's enemy had recourse to a wily stratagem to overcome this difficulty by declaring that as B had confirmed the truth of his proposals to A's family by his manifest communications, and having done this, it was not necessary that B should bestow them any more, and that they had ceased.

On this principle he succeeded to deceive multitudes, of A's family, and the messengers that A's enemy had thus instructed went forth proclaiming against B's messengers, declaring they had the power to adopt children into the family of B, and that B had ceased to confer his gifts on his adopted children, that B had proven he had power to do so, and having done this it was sufficient, and multitudes by this device of A's enemy were deceived.

Great confusion reigned in A's family, but the time hastened to a close when B was to put his children into possession of the promised inheritence in full, and in order to do this he had to cast down A's enemy with all his followers; he commenced his work of preparing for the crowning of his children, and he east down A's enemy, taking away his power, exposing his deception, and destroying all power out of his hands. No sooner was the work done and A's enemy with all his followers cast down, and B's family put in possession of their rights as his children, than the eyes of the rest of A's family were opened in deep dismay and horror; they then saw what they had lost, they did not upbraid themselves because they were A's children naturaly and thereby doomed to shame, but their great sorrow was they had refused to be adopted into the family of B when he made the kind proposal, they saw their case desperate. Those who had been adopted they knew were reigning in great power, and great glory; and they were not only suffering the common shame of the family, but had to endure the mortification of knowing that they also might have been reigning as did their brethren, if they had only been adopted into the family of B, but now it was lost, forever lost, and there were weeping, wailing, and guashing of teeth among them, and all this because B had placed it within their power to become members of his family and heir with him all his glory.

"This is the condemnation that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil," and not because they were sinners by Adam.

"He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned," not because they were sinners in Adam, but because they believed not on the only begotten son of God.

# REFLECTIONS ON THE DUTY OF MAN.

Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others, do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect. even as your Father-winch is in heaven is perfect. Matthew 5:43-48.

All believers in the scriptures of divine truth will readily acknowledge that Jesus Christ, the saviour of the world, whose words we all have quoted above, was a personage who perfectly understood the principles by which the children of men should be governed in order to become the children of their father which is in heaven." How few there are of those who profess to be the followers of the meek and lowly Jesus, yes we may say how few of those even who have been legally adopted into the church and kingdom of the Son of God, who duly consider the importance of the injunctions made by our Savior, in the words of our text.

When we consider the character of the person delivering those remarkable sayings, the circumstances under which they were delivered, and the persons to whom they were addressed, and that they contain eternal-principles which affect all mankind, we are led to marvel greatly at the apparent little or no attention paid to them by the professing christian world, who claim to be the Lord's disciples, and consequently the children of God. We learn in the first verses of this fifth chapter, that Jesus, "seeing the multitude, went up into a mountain; and when he was set, his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught THEM." Here we find our Savior addressing himself to his disciples, who had been willing to take up their cross and follow him, and must, necessarily, have obeyed the gospel of the kingdom which he had been preaching to the world. Among the many glorious and ennobling principles set forth in these instructions, to the disciples, are these words: "ye have heard that it hath been said, thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy: But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which dispitefuly use you and persecute you:"

And why this strict requirement, so different from the usages and custoins of the world, -and-even the law of Moses, under which the disciples had been raised and tutored! In the

145th verse we find the answer and the reason why such requirements were made; "That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:"

Is it actually necessary to be governed by such principles as these, after we enter into the new and everlasting covenant by the door, even that of faith, repentance, baptism for the remission of sins, and received the imposition of hands for the reception of the Holy Spirit,are these things ye' to be observed in order to become the children of God? So it appears from the sayings of our Savior on this occasion; for he, says, "But I say unto you," [disciples] do these things "that you may be the children of your father which is in heaver."

Here is a principle set forth worthy the attention of all professing christians. How pleasant and desirable a society governed by them. How different from the order of things which prevail throughout the world. Yet we all who attain to the exalted privilege of becoming heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, must let these things be the governing principles of their action, that they may be assimilated into his likeness, and be prepared for his society when he comes to make up his jewels. It is upon these principles that the heavens are governed, and the earth is permitted to stand; for if God was like man, who can never rest or feel satisfied while his enemy has a name or a place among the land of the living, how long since would the heavens have been as brass over our heads, and the earth as iron under our feet, and man would have withered and passed away like the flower of the morning before the scorching rays of the noon-day sun? "But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which dispitefully use you and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."

All people, who profess faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, admit that he came to open a way and an effectual door, whereby man can, through an obedience to his will, be exalted to the right hand of his "Father which is in heaven;" and that our Savior, in making manifest this way of life, was a pattern for us in all things, not only in deed, but in word also; that the principles which he came to set develop, were not only important and necessary, but were fraught with eternal consequences; and that man is placed here in a probationary state, where he can obey those principles, and learn those lessons which are necessary to be learned and practised, to prepare him for that glory which is to be revealed at the coming of the Son of man.

This then being the case, and these things being required by the Captain of our salvation, it follows of necessity, that without an observance of those principles, and living in obedi

MORMON OUTRAGE.
DEAR SIR: A few days
ago I visited the city of New York, where I
met with brother McLellin. It gave me joy
to learn the work of the Lord was rolling on
with such rapidity as it is; my prayer is, that
the kingdom of God may roll on with Majesty
and power, until the kingdoins of this world
become the subjects and kingdoms of our God
and-his Christ, Amen.

MESSRS. EDITORS: On Tuesday morning
last, 9th inst., an attack was made on a
school house in Rocky Run Precinct, by some
persons unknown, but supposed to be Mormons
in which there was at the time of attack a
convention of anti-Mormons, or old settlers
of the County. The doors and windows of
the house were completely riddled by the
shots fired by the assilants. The attacking
party approached under cover of the woods
and bushes and fired one round and fled.
No person was injured, but many were, I
presume much frightened at this sudden and
unexpected assault. The old settlers in that
section of the county armed themselves for
defence, and if they are backed by their
friends in other parts of the country, blood
will flow. By, a messenger just in, who
came to purchase lead, powder, flints, &c. I

wounded, but not mortaly. Yesterday thir

# PROSPECTUS
FOR THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE
MESSENGER & ADVOCATE
OF THE
CHURCH OF CHRIST.

As the first volume of the MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE is drawing to a close, we deem it advisable to give our patrons and friends an early notice of our intention to continue its publication.

The comencement of this paper was under circumstances very peculiar and trying. We were under the painful necessity of lifting our pens and voices against an apostacy the most daring, and of opposing doctrines the most revolting, demoralizing, and destructive, that ever mortals were called upon to witness; especially in a civilized community; and we think it exceedingly doutbful if the history of the most barbarous or heathen nations can show a parallel; we mean the private teachings and practices of the leaders at Nauvoo.

To save the church of Christ from an entire ruin and overthrow, required an effort worthy of the high and exalted end to be obtained. This effort we felt willing to make, agreeably to the requirements of our heavenly Father. knowing that with his aid and blessings this glorious object could be accomplished; and we have the unspeakable privilege of seeing that our labours have not been fruitless or-vain, but have been attended with abundant success, through the goodness, and under the guidance of him who hath said, "though heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or title of my word shall fail."

To show the true state of the church, and give the full account of its re-organization, and the establishment of the kingdom of God, and also set forth the doctrines of the kingdom

diate action. He was very upon the Executive of the State for the indifferent manner in which he administers the laws. The applause with which his speech was received, shows that a spirit is aroused among our people, which will not be quieted until the backs of the Mormons are turned upon Illinois.

Finally, an amendment proposed by. A. Johnson, Esq. to the resolutions, which gave power to the chairman to call another meeting so soon as the coinmittee of five shall return from Nauvoo, was adopted together with the resolutions, by an unanimous vote.

The proposition for ONE THOUSAND to visit Hancock meets with universal approbation.

Public sentiment is decidedly against the Mormons-They Must Go and Backenstos feel the full force of law for killing Worrel!! Our best Lawyers-pronounce it an act of murder-for which the sheriff had not the shadow of law.

lin detail, as they are contained in the scriptures, we knew would require a paper to be published oftener than once a month, therefore we concluded to publish the first volume semi monthly, which we have done at a reduced price-much lower in fact than wo could afford to do in justice to ourselves-it has been attended with a vast amount of labor in preparing the matter, which is almost entirely original, and will compose when completed, a work of 384 closely printed octavo pages the expense also has been heavy upon a few irdividuals, which however has been borne with cheerfulness, knowing the importance of the work to be accomplished.

The great object for publishing this periodical being in a great measure obtained-the church of Christ being re-organized upon its original, and only sure foundation-and the kingdom of heaven established, and rolling forth with success and prosperity-wo have come to the conclusion to publish the second volume orce a month only; which will very materially lessen the expenses, and relieve us from a heavy burthen.

The Messenger and Advocate, as heretovote, will continuer to give the progress of the cause of trath threnghout the world-it will contain essays upon the glorious plan of salvation-and will also be a medium through which the Elders of the Church of Christ can communicate their feelings and success in the ministry. No pain's will be spared, on our part, to make the Messenger an interesting and useful sheet, such an one as the wants of the saints demand; and we entertain no fears hat we shall be suffered to pass unrewarded for our toils.

TERMS:-One Dollar per annum, payable, in all cases in advance; as we cannot send the paper to any except the pay accompany the order. Any person procuring five new subscribers, and forwarding us five dollars current money, shall receive one volume gratis. All letters must be addressed to the publisher, Post Paid, to receive attention.
