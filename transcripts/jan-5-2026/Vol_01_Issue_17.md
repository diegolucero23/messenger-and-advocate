# SERMON No. 2

DEDICATED TO THE SAINTS OF THE LAST DAYS.

BY 8. RIGDON.

[Continued from page 248.]

Hebrews 2d chapter 6th verse: "What is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?"

The instance as quoted which took place at Ephesus, is another evidence of this same power in man, see the 6th verse of the 19th chapter of Acts, as above quoted. Paul "laid his hands on them," after they were baptised, "and they received the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues and prophecied." But if any are led yet to dispute the fact of this power in man, by which he can be saved, in the Savior's prayer recorded in the 16th chapter of John's gospel, the fact is again set forth in a manner most unanswerably. See John's gospel 17th chapter from the 20th to the close of the 24th verse, 'Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.-

Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thour lovedst me before the foundation of the world.' By reading the former part of this prayer, and then the verses we have quoted, nothing can be made plainer than the fact, that the Savior received all menas possessing the same capacities of holding communion with God. He here prays that those who might believe on him through the word of the apostles, might be one with the apostles, and one with the Father and the Son, as the apostles were. How could this be done? there could be but one way, and that was, the way to by which the apostles became one with the Father and the Son. Now if this prayer of the Savior is ever fulfilled, who can but see that the persons here said to believe on Christ through the apostles word, must have the power to do so. In the 21st verse it is said, speaking of those who believed through the apostles word; That they all may be one' be one. Hence when the gospel was received, and hande laid on those who were baptized

word and the apostles themselves, 'as thou, Father, art in me and 1 in thee.' How was Christ one. with the Father? it was by the spirit of holiness which dwelt in both, and the same spirit of revelation which dwelt in the apostles, and by which they were made one with the father and the son; and how could those who believed through the apostles word become one with them all? No answer but one can be given, by the same spirit by which the Father and the Son becaine one, and by which the apostles became one with the Father and the Son, and what adds force to it is that it is said in the 22d verse "And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they might be one even as we are one." Now who was it to whom this glory was given? the answer is to both the apostles and those who believed through their word.-

In the above sayings of the Savior the capacities of man and his capabilities are set forth in a way not to be mistaken. Man is capable of being one with the Father and the Son, of being united in oneness with them; and happy for our investigation, we have had the whole subject in language which cannot be mistaken. For this cause the Savior gave his word to man, that man might be one with him and the Father; and he also gave them his glory, that they might be one with him and the Father. Man then must be capable of being so or else the Savior would not have deigned and to give him the means of becoming so.

We have now hefore us the whole, design of God in revealing himself to man, it was because of the capabilities of man to be made like himself, to be one with him, for this cause the Savior deigned to die for man. To this end the gospel was sent to man. To this end it was that God proposed to raise him from the dead. Man was capable of an exaltation that he knew nothing about, but God knew what man who was, and therefore was "mindful of him" and knew who the son of man was therefore "visited him."

It matters not whether it is apostles or those who believed on their word, the object to be obtained was the same, that they all may be one with the Father and the Son.. It is because of this that the same gospel was sent, that all through believing and obeying might obtain a union with the Deity, and be sharers in his wisdom, power, and glory. For this cause the promise of "the gift of the Holy Ghost" was given to all, that all might be one. Hence when the gospel was received, and hande laid on those who were baptized

above all others should be careful not to be deceived.

It has not been our object however in the preceding remarks, to do away with the idea that the true servants of God in the kingdom of Jesus Christ, who will prepare it for his advent, will not be inspired and have visions and miraculous power given them from heaven; in order to bring about the purposes of God: and that too as marvelously as in the days of Moses, and even more so, to assist them to overcome and ruin the power of the devil. No.
But our object has been to show that false notions exist relative to the power and privilege of true prophets of God, and to put all the lovers of truth on their guard, so that they may understand and obey the command of the Savior, "Take heed lest any man deceive you."
Now if we believe the inspired writings that are generally believed and received as canonl ical, we are bound to believe that God will work by miraculous power through' his ser-vants in the age—the very age in which the Messiah will come. The prophecies of Isaiah are very plain upon the subject. "And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river and smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry shod. And there shall be an high way for the remnent of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt." * Neither the Red sea which lies east of Egypt, nor the river Nile which empties it-self into the Mediterranean by seven principal mouths has ever as yet been particularly disturbed in their beds, or any high way been cast-up there. But to fulfil the prophecy, it will require at some future period, an omnipo-tent arm stretched out over them in miracu-lous, yes marvelous power. A mighty agitation in nature in order to throw up that "high way," for the redeemed to walk on. In his 25 chapter he speaks of the power that will be displayed at that important period. "Then that the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped: then shall the lame man leap as an heart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing, for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert." No person who believes in the restora-tion of scatered Israel to the lands of their inheritance again, will doubt or can doubt but that God will bring them back by power.-
Will return them again as he led them from Egypt by giving to his servants, whom he will raise up, power supernatural power, even surpassing Mossos and Aaron.

Jeremiah says on this subject, "Therefore, behold the days come saith the Lord, that it shall no more be said, the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel out of the and of Egypt; but the Lord liveth that brought hem up from the land of the north, and from 'I the lands whether he had driven them; and

#

I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers." Why will it no more be said that the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Isreal from Egypt? Every Jew in all past ages as well as the present, looks back with feelings of pride, and points the world to the mighty displays of God's power in their behalf, as their fathers were passing from Egypt to Canaan. But says the prophet, there will come a time in the history of that distinguished nation that those miracles wrought by Moses and Joshua, will not come into remembrance—not even mentioned, in consequence of the superlative ex-cellence and grandeur of those displays which God will make in their behalt, when the time comes for their restoration from all countries whither they have been "a hiss and a by-word." Power, yes, marvellously miracu-lous power must be shown forth, or they never will cease to mention those miracles exerted in behalf of their fathers in their journey to the Canaan.

The Lord seems to have had two objects in the view in giving man power to work miracles. First, to arrest the attention of unbelievers, and cause them to investigate the truth. Secondly, the immediate benefit of the person or persons on whom, or for whom the power was exerted. Miracles never converted any person to the knowledge of the true God, nor never will. They were performed in Egypt, yet Pharaoh and his court were hardened—they perished in the Red sea. Hundreds and thousands of Jews perished in the land of their fathers, by the hands of the Romas, although they had seen and known the stupendous counteractions of the laws of nature by Jesus, and his apostles. Signs did not convert Pharaoh nor Herod, but they were hardened and fell. Faith and obedience to the truth alone convert the sinner from the error of his way. And after he becomes a believer of the gospel and follower of the Lamb, then the words of the. Savior are that "signs shall follow them that believe," This accords with Paul's view of belief or faith. He says "Faith comes by hearing." Now if faith comes by hearing the word of God, it does not come by seeing miracles. But miracles and signs serve to confirm the true believer. Mark 16: 20, "The Lord working with them, (the believers) and -in-conferming the word with signs following, amen." Paul writes in the same strain Heb. 2: 4, "God also bearing them witness (the believers) both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will." Ifthe notion of the learned is true that power to work miracles is the test of a prophet sent of God, then the Lord would hold himself bound to give every one that he sent power to perform them. And no people would be under condemnation for rejecting a prophet until after he had performed miracles to prove his mission. Upon this principle we would be com-

## The great and uniform object of all the rev-
elations that God has ever given or manifest-
ed to man, from the days of Adam to the pres
ent time, has been to develop his own charac-
ter, and show to man that he might form rela-
tions with the heavens, so firm, and so fixed,
that all the combinations of earth and hell
could not deceive him. After man has formed
those relations with his heavenly Father, has
been adopted into his kingdom, and has receiv-
ed the spirit of adoption the spirit of theses
kingdom-the earnest of his inheritance; then
if he lives to his privilege false Apostles may
testify, false Prophets may prophesy; and if
the people desire it, they may "heap to them-
selves teachers having itching ears, they may
turn away their ears from the truth and be
turned unto fables," Yet the man with the
seal of his adoption in his heart, with an "unc-
tion from the Holy One, may know all things."
He may know whether God has sent the apos-
tle, prophet, or teacher, or whether he is a de-
ceiver. John said to the saints in his day "ye
know all things." 1st John 2; 20. It was at
upon this principle of knowledge that Paul
said to his brethren of Thessalonica, "but ye
brethren are not in darkness, that that day
should overtake you as a thief. Ye are the
children of light." James, the apostle, laid
down in the kingdom of Christ one general,
grand principle of action. And if that princi-
ple was only lived to, no man need ever be
deceived by falsé apostles, prophets or teach-
ers. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
úpbraideth not: and it shall be given him."
James 1: 5. This is the great key or princi-
ple, which throws wide open the door of intel-
ligence to man.

Suppose the true signs of the coming of the
Son of man should appear, the sun should be
darkened, the moon turned to blood, and the
stars begin to fall from heaven. How, we
would ask, may it be known that those signs
are then given to announce the advent? We will
answer, if the saint's mind is in doubt, if he
lacks wisdom, if he knows not the object for
which the signs are shown, he looks up to
God and says, Father give me knowledge of
those things; give me wisdom that I may
know what to do. His God gives hiin liberaly.
He stands then without fear, in the midst of
- the wreck of nations, and the contention of
elements-trusting in his heavenly Father.

But how may a true prophet be known from
a false one? We are well aware that to an
swer this query correctly, requires deep re
search, reflection, and combination of princi
ples, times, characters, and circumstances.
No man with the bible history before him can
help but see the difficulties under which all
the true prophets of God were placed. When
they had a message to deliver to the world, they
generally, may we not say, universally, had not
to go-at their peril, and combat the prejudices
of the age in which they lived; the systems of


rev-corruption which had been introduced by false
est-prophets, or false teachers, or both; who had
res prophesied or taught lies in the name of the
rac-Lord, and in consequence thereof the practices
rela- of the people had become so corrupt, that they
fixed, called aloud for vengeance from heaven; but
hell that God who is "abundant in goodness truth
med and mercy," "at sundry times and in divers
has manners spake in time past unto the fathers
receiv-by the prophets," in order to correct their abu
by-ses and lead them back unto himself, lest his
then judgements should fall upon them for their
destruction.

The people to whom the Lord sent his pro
phets, had generally become so wedded to
their transgressions and the false teachers had
b obtained such an influence over them, that
the they usually rose up and killed the prophets,
and stoned them that were sent unto them."
Now if the test that the people of this age
have set up, by which to determine true from
de false prophets, that is, power to work miracles,
fa is a correct one, how easy would it have been,
was at any time for the Lord, "Who hath measur
Paulled the waters in the hollow of his hand, and
yemeted out the heavens with a span, compre
day hended the dust of the earth in a measure, and
the weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills
laid in a balance," to have given to every prophet
that power by which he could have convinced
his hearers, and thus have saved his prophets
from horrid persecutions, privations, and gen
erally an untimely-and-not unfrequently a
ask horrid death?

and "True prophets were always sent to cry re
penitance, to reform those to whom they were
sent, to lay down principles that would better
their condition, that if observed, would elevate
their characters before God. False prophets
cry peace, peace, all is well. "No evil shall
come upon you." Jer. 23. 17. The prophe
cies of true prophets always did and always will
welcome to pass, because God spake through them,
"For prophecy came not in old time by the
will of man: but holy men of God spake as they
were moved by the Holy Girost." 2d Peter 1:
21. False prophets are not seers, they cannot
look into the future, their prophecies therefore
are all uncertainty. Their inspiration is from
the devil, or they speak from the imagination
of their own hearts. If a prophet appears be
fore any people and makes a declaration or
delivers a message, and that declaration or
message is derogatory to the true character of
God, or is contrary to any fixed principle as
laid down in the divine volume, then that
man is not sent of God; but his inspiration is
from beneath. Because a man sent of God
will speak his word, and the Lord would not
speak against his own character or against
any word that he had ever given to any former
prophet. The Lord said Isaiah 8: 20, "To
the law and to the testimony, if they speak
had not according to this word, it is because their
is no light in them." A message delivered

# COMMUNICATIONS

## THE MORMONS.

We have a few words to say in relation to Nauvoo and the attitude we sustain to that people. There is an attempt made and making by that people, to make all believe, over whom they have any influence, that we are some how or other engaged in trying to bring mobs on them or to inflame the public mind against them; this we do not believe we have power to do if we had any desire to do so; we say let the Lord judge whether we have or not.

All that we have ever said, or intend to say, or ever did intend to say about that people, was to make all acquainted with the true state of the case, as it existed between them and us. We did see a disposition on the part of that people, to mislead the public mind on the subject, and make a wrong impression on them. The object we had in view has been obtained, and since all the facts have been elicited, necessary to the accomplishment of that object, we are not disposed to keep up a war with them or any other people.

As to their peculiar religious tenets which was the cause of the real difference between them and us, and out of which the evils grew which are effecting them, and likely to do it, belongs to themselves, and as far as we are concerned, they may enjoy them, since the public know or may know, both through their own writings and ours, what the real difference is; these called-forth all we have said in relation to them, it being our firm conviction that they were not according to Godliness.

The proofs they gave to the world that we were seeking their lives, have so plainly shewn that they were mistaken, if they thought so, that a word is all that is necessary. They sent forth the alarm that we were colliging with certain men who they said were the active agents in the death of, the Smiths. Namely the messis Laws, Fosters, Higbees, & Bennett, facts have proven that between them and us, there was no concert of action. We had a conversation, last winter in Ohio, with Mr. William Law whom we unexpectedly met on his way to visit his brothers, in Mercer co. in this state. The conversation was a friendly one, but terminated in convincing both parties that our religious views were so widely different that no union could exist, and so we parted, agreeing to disagree, and so the matter ended. As to the others mentioned, we never had any conversation with them, and the facts have settled the question in dispute, if there ever were one, that none of them had any disposition to unite with us in a church relation, but we consider they have a right to any do so, if they comply with what we consider the only way of admission, which is baptism for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Spirit, as all others attain their standing with us.

The letter from brother N. B. Helverson, found in another column, will be read with deep interest, as it sets forth in plainness the principles by which P. P. Pratt and his adherents are governed.

## EXTRACTS OF LETTERS.

We have received letters from our brethren from different points, which we cannot publish at length, but we make the following extracts:

Elder G. M. Hinkle writes from Buffalo I. T. June '45-Dear Brethren, in the kingdom and common cause of our Master, I am glad to inform you that the Lord has already fulfilled his promises to me in a great degree as made when I was set apart to this mission; for he has given us near one hundred of my old brethren and we have had the pleasure of leading them down into the waters of baptism, and through the ordinances of introducing them into the kingdom of God. The prospects are more and more flattering every day in this region of country."

Elders H. Kellogg and L. Rich write from Kirtland O.. June 28 '45. "When we returned from conference we commenced teaching and exhorting the brethren and sisters to holy living, and our meetings have been very interesting. We have baptized thirteen, and we think there are more here who will soon follow their example. We have confidence that the good brethren of the grand council will have wisdom to do all things according to the pattern, and to bear off the Kingdom triumphant"

Also from S. Wardell Longbranch N. J. July 8. 1845. "Our worthy bro. G. Divine has just arrived at our place in good health. I wish you to continue to send me the Messenger and Advocate. I like it much, very much indeed. I send one dollar enclosed to pay for it for one year."

We make the following extract from a letter received from brother Joseph Reeve of Woodstown, N. J. dated July 1, 1845. It is a source of great satisfaction to us, to receive the many testimonials from our brethren abroad in various parts of the country, manifesting their firmness and integrity in the cause of truth.

"Sir, please send me all the numbers of the Messenger from the] commencement. - We have not had any papers nor has any Elder been here since Brother Rigdon was here last fall. The twelveites have been to visit us, but we stand firm to our post. Brother Robison is well and in good spirits.

N. B. HELVERSON.

Boston, June 24, 1845.

PRESIDENT S. RIGDON:

Dear Brother in Christ, I take my pen to
drop a few lines to you at this time.

God knows, worlds of wealth is of no val
ue to the gospel of our blessed-Saviour; my
soul grows larger and expands in the light
and glory of God. I have been to the East, Pr.
I preached in the Baptist church Sunday before
last; with intense anxiety the people heard
me in the forenoon, and desired their Elder to
give way for me in the afternoon, to which he
consented. 1-gladly embraced the opportuni
ty, and tried to leave no stone unturned to
show them the first principles of the gospel,
and the organization of the kingdom of God.
Left them in a good state of feeling, all bun
the Elder, he was very uneasy but treated me
gentlemanly; may God bless him and his
church to imbrace the gospel. In Boston last
Sunday I preached 3 times, and once in Cam
bridgeport where I now live.

While I was gone to the East, my house
was assailed in the night time by a band of
rumans, who insulted my family with hard
words and foul speeches, to their great anoy
ance, until they were compelled to calk on
their neighbors for assistance and protection.
When I returned and found the treatinent so
gross, without the least provocation my feel
ings were very much-excited, and I made an
effort to ferret out the offenders; the neighbors
were very much stired up about it; never was
known so gross an insult on a respectable fam
ily in this region of country. But now came
the test of my religion, up comes a man in a
čarriage for me to go to Boston to lay hands on
his aged mother, who was supposed to be dy
ing, I felt I had a wrong spirit, but I took
my oil and went. This showed me the im
portance of being always ready. I told the
Lord, like Sampson, if he would return to me,
I would submit all persecufors to his charge,
and pray for them. The spirit of the living
God came with power while I looked on the
dying woman; I was astonished, she had not
so much as opened her eyes, neither spoker,
or even noticed any one for some time; but
the spirit bid me pray; I did. It bid me a
noint and lay on my hands. The old lady
turned over from a doubled up position in
bed, and looked up. Such was the marvel-

fous change, that her children and grand chil
dren were greatly-ainazed, they all burst forth
all into a flood of tears. Color came in her face
like a child, she fell asleep, and I told them.
Spirit said if she sleeps she shall do
well. The night's rest refreshed her, and the
next day she talked with her children all about
the goodness of God. I went the second time.
and her sons and daughters all kneeled down,
while I prayed, and. God blessed me in a won
derful manner. One of the sons-told me it was
the first time he ever knelt before God, but
hoped it would not be the last. She got up
after I left the room; she is a miracle indeed.
I think the whole family will embrace the gos
pel. I spent part of the day with them yes
terday.

Sunday we had a heavenly time in our church,
the spirit of God rested upon us, the spirit of
my prophecy was poured out in great effusion,
and I can assure you it came with mighty pow
er. The brethren and sisters came together
last night at my house, to partake of the Lord's
supper; and such prophecying by the spirit I
never heard in this vicinity. And to tell you
the whole story in a word, I have been filled
with perfect love ever since this persecution
to arose falsely for Christ's sake,
I preached on the town scales in Cambridge
port last sunday morning at 8 o'clock, to hun
dreds. The most respectable came up and
took me by the hand and expressed the best of
his feelings toward me. All the respectable part
of the place talke as much again notice of my
unusual persecutions as I do. * My
soul is happy, praise the Lord, peace on earth,
and good will to man.
Now Sir, the desire of the honest in this re
ligion of country is, that you should come here
and spend some time. The citizens of Peter
boro, are very anxious for you to come and
make them a visit, and lay before them the
principles of life. Trejoice to hear the pros
pect of the saints abroad. I wish you health
and happiness and that the blessings of God+
may ever be with you.
From your unworthy brother.
