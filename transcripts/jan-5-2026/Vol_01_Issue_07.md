# THE PURPOSES OF GOD.

As time progresses, and the events of the last days are multiplying, the interest of the biblical student increases, and his desire to understand the things that were written afore time for our learning, grows more intent, and more fervent are the deep feelings of his heart in search of intelligence pertaining to the future events of the world. For a long time party has been contending against party, and strife and dissatisfaction have been spreading abroad, and political animosities have been severing the cords of union, and unstringing the nerves of government. The voice of oppression and the voice of the oppressed are heard in the land. The rattling of the servant's chains, and the scourge of the master's rod, are all multiplying the miseries of man; and civilization, that benefactor of the human ráce, is used as an engine of oppression in the hands of tyrants, to scourge into submission the more unfortunate of the family of man.

At a time like this, where can we look, and to whom can we look, but to the God who made us, to satisfy the aching void, to allay the useless anxiety, and take away the gloom of suspense from the heart of him who desires to look into the future, and see the ultimate destiny of his race.

To this end were prophets commissioned, and messengers sent. To this end were angels consecrated, and heavenly agents authorized to bear intelligence nce from the throne of God to man, that the future might be opened, and the dark curtain which concealed it might be removed, and man might peruse the history of his race, until the morn of the resurrection changed the complexion of all things below.

Man, who is capable of holding communion with his God, and sensible of his privilege, cannot nor will not cease, until darkness is turned into light, and suspense into certainty, and the dark vail of futurity rolled up, and the light of invisible things illuminates his heart, and the history of his race is revealed.

To this end the prophets and apostles labored night and day before the Lord that they inight understand the things to come, and we are told the angels desire to look into these things-the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow.

In view of obtaining this end they sought for visions and revelations the opening of the heavens, and the spirit of revelation; and the result of their researches hey have recorded in the scriptures, from which we learn many important facts.

One of these important facts is that that same Jesus who was crucified is to come to this earth again, Acts Ist chapter, 10th and 11th verses, "And while they looked stead fastly towards heaven as he went up, behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, and shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven." But he is not to come until many events yet future have transpired. The Jews are to say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Matthew 23:38, 39, "Behold your house is leftunto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." And before this takes place, there are to be great commotions on the earth-wars and rumors of wars; nation to rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom; and famines and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places, and these only the beginning of sorrows: "And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows." Matt. 24: 6,7,8. Isaiah's account of what shall take place, in the 24th chapter of his prophecy, is set forth in strong language, all preparatory to his coming to reign on Mount Zion and Jerusalem. All the prophets and apostles have spoken the same things. There is not one of the sacred writers but have written of these things. The prophet Zechariah describes the precise circumstances, under which the Savior will come. It will be at a time when all nations will be gathered against Jerusalem to battle, and during that notable battle the Lord is to come and all the saints with him, and stand on the Mount of Olives. It is vain for the believers in the second coming of Christ to look for his coming at any other time, or under any other circumstances, for we have as good reason to believe he will not come at all, as to believe he will come under any other circumstances than those described by Zachariah; for all the prophets have said that wars, and great wars, will precede his coming, and to suppose no such thing will take place before and at the time of his coming, is to suppose the sacred writers were all mistaken, and if mistaken about the circumstances under which he was to come, as well might they be mistaken about the fact, and

Our chief aim shall be to unite a people, be

eternal life; having a correct conception of the
purposes of God in the last dispensation; un-
derstanding the things written by the prophets,
and thereby seeing eye to eye. It is to such a

## THE AUTHORITY OF THE APOS-
TATE TWELVE.

All the enormous pretensions, and high sound-
ing assumption of the dictatorship, by the apos-
tate Twelve, hang upon ONE slender thread;
to wit: the assertion that Joseph Smith invest-
ed them with the authority, to bear off the bur-
den of the church! Sever this attenuated
thread, and they fall like Lucifer never to rise
again! With the revelations of Jesus Christ
in our hand, we are at no loss whether to cut it
or let it hang. With the word of God, which
is sharper than a two edged sword, we sunder
at one blow, the lying dependence; and down,
down, DOWN fall the apostate Twelve, to ever-
lasting shame and contempt, So true is the in-
spired aphorisın, "he that exalteth HIMSELF
shall be abased."

We shall shew by a "thus saith the Lord,
that Joseph Smith had no power or authority
to confer upon any one-after he had ordained
Sydney Rigdon a prophet, seer, and revelator!
We quote from the 14th section of the book of
Covenants, "And this ye shall know assuredly,
that there is none other appointed unto you to
receive commandments and revelations until he
be taken if he abide in me. But verily, verily
I say unto you that none else shall be appointed
unto this gift except it be through him, for if it
be taken from him he shall not have power, ex-
cept to appoint another in his stead: and this
shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the
teachings of any that shall come before you as
in revelations or commandments; and, this I give
unto you, that you may not be deceived, that
and you may know they are not of me." We learn
from this that no prophet, seer, and revelator
was to be appointed during Joseph's life time
unless he forfeited his gift and standing by
transgression. But in case he should so trans-
gress, all the power that was then left him, was
simply to appoint another in his stead. The
moment then Joseph Smith ordained the indi-
vidual, whom the Lord intended to stand in his
(Joseph's) stead, that instant all power and au-
thority as a legal revelator to the church, had
departed from him; and in fact all power, in
the kingdom of God; for "he shall not have
power, except to appoint another in his stead."

The accursed spiritual wife revelation, came
through a fallen prophet, and came to deceive.
If those who had covenanted to "keep all the
commandments of God, unto the end," had
searched diligently for the law of God, they
would have known-when the proclamation
went forth to the world, that Joseph Smith had
ordained Hyrum Smith, and Sydney Rigdon,
as prophets, seers and revelators-that he (Jo-
seph) was no longer the legal revelator to the
church, because of transgression.

The Twelve then received all their tremend-
ous keys and authority from a fallen prophet!
who had"no power" to give! Blind infatuation!
A deceived heart hath turned them aside, from
the holy commandments delivered unto us.

The "spiritual wife" conclave, as we gather
from the Prophet and Times and Seasons, have
concluded to let us alone. We marvel, that
such adepts at lying and slander should so soon
have exhausted their inventive genius, when
not a single number of their papers has hitherto
reached us, that did not exhibit a surprising
aptitude in their conductors, for the manufac-
ture of FICTION. The last number of the Times
and Seasons, charges Président Rigdon with

## ANSWER TO THE ABOVE.

To our strange corespondent D. K. your
views of the difference, between us and the
Mormons, are correct. It has been our desire
to make the public acquainted with the real
difference between us and them; as we saw
the Mormons using every effort in their power,
without any regard to truth whatever, to abus
the public mind, and conceal from the public
eye the real cause of our opposition to them.
It is gratifying, therefore, to us to find that
our efforts to disabuse the public mind have
not been in vain.

## APOSTACY OF THE CHURCH.

Zion lies waste, and thy Jerusalem,
O Lord, is fall'n to utter desolation;
Against thy prophets and thy holy men,
The Sin hath wrought a fatal combination,
Profaned thy name, thy worship overthrown,
And made Thee, living Lord, a God unknown.

Thy powerful laws, thy wonders of creation,
Thy word Incarnate, glorious heaven, dark hell,
Lie shadow'd under man's degeneration,
Thy Christ still, crucified for doing well:
Impiety, O Lord, sits on thy throne, [known.
Which makes Thee, living Light, a God un-

Man's superstition doth thy truth entomb,
His atheism again her pomp defaceth;
Sin earthly, sensual, devilish, doth consume
What was thy church, thy present church dis-
graceth;
There lives, no truth with them that were thine [own,
Which makes Thee, living Lord, a God un-
known.

Yet unto Thee, Lord, mirror of transgression,
We, who for earthly idols have forsaken
Thy heavenly image, sinless, púre impression,
And so in nets of vanity been taken,
-All penitent implore that to thine own,
Lord, thou no longer live a God unknown.

Yet, Lord, let Israel's plagues not be eternal,
Nor sin forever cloud, thy sacred mountains;
Nor, with false flames, spiritual, but infernal,
Dry up thy mercy's ever springing fountains
Rather, sweet Jesus, fill up time, and come
To yield the Sin her everlasting doom.

## A PARABLE.

There were two men, both dwellers in one town,

The other poor having norox, nor calf,
Nor other cattle save one little lamb, [hand;

And it grew up and fed with him and his,
And ate and drank as he and his were wont,
And in his bosom slept, and was to live
As his own daughter, or his dearest child.
There came a stranger to the wealthy man;
And he refused and spared to take his own,
Or of his store to dress and make him meet
But took the poor man's sheep, the poorman's

And dressed it for the stranger in his house.
