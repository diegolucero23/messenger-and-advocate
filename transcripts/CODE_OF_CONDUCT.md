# Contributor Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the "Messenger and Advocate" transcription project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to prioritize **historical accuracy** and **textual fidelity** above all personal, theological, or ideological agendas.

## 2. Our Standards

This repository deals with sensitive historical documents regarding the succession crisis of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We anticipate that contributors may come from diverse backgrounds—including believers of various restoration branches, critics, secular historians, and curious onlookers.

To ensure this project succeeds, we require all participants to adhere to the following standards:

### ✅ Examples of Positive Behavior
* **Focusing on the Text:** The primary goal is to verify that the digital text matches the physical scan. Discussions should remain centered on OCR errors, spelling variants, and formatting.
* **Using Welcoming Language:** Being inclusive and respectful to those with differing viewpoints on the history.
* **Being Respectful of Differing Viewpoints:** Acknowledging that the historical figures mentioned (Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young, etc.) are viewed differently by different groups, but treating the *document* as the authority for this project.
* **Graceful Constructive Criticism:** Accepting feedback on transcription errors without taking it personally.
* **Empathy:** Showing empathy towards other community members.

### 🚫 Examples of Unacceptable Behavior
* **Theological Debating:** The Issues tab and Pull Requests are **not** forums for debating the truth claims of the text. Whether you believe Sidney Rigdon was a prophet or a fraud is irrelevant to whether the word on Page 15 is spelled "shewing" or "showing."
* **Proselytizing or De-conversion Efforts:** Attempting to convert contributors to or away from any specific faith tradition.
* **Derogatory Comments:** The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* **Trolling:** Insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* **Harassment:** Public or private harassment.
* **Doxing:** Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

## 3. Policy on Historical Neutrality

This repository is an archive, not a pulpit.

* **For Believers:** Do not "sanitize" the text to remove embarrassing historical details or contradictions. If the text contains errors or controversial statements by historical figures, they must remain.
* **For Critics:** Do not use the repository tools (Issues/PRs) to mock the text or the beliefs of others. Do not add "commentary" or "sic" tags that are editorial in nature rather than correctional.

**Rule of Thumb:** If a comment explains *what the text says*, it is welcome. If a comment explains *why the text is true/false/good/bad*, it belongs on a separate forum, not here.

## 4. Enforcement Responsibilities

The project maintainer (@diegolucero23) is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The maintainer has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 5. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (Repositories, Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## 6. Enforcement Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Enforcement Matrix

**1. Correction**
* **Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
* **Consequence:** A private, written warning from the maintainer, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**2. Warning**
* **Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
* **Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**3. Temporary Ban**
* **Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
* **Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**4. Permanent Ban**
* **Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
* **Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.
