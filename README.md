# Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate (1844-1847)

> **Historical Transcriptions Project** > *Accurate, searchable, and structured OCR transcriptions of the original Sidney Rigdon "Messenger and Advocate" newspaper.*

## 📜 About The Project

This repository contains the first complete, high-accuracy transcription of the *Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate*, originally published between October 1844 and 1846.

For decades, the only available versions of these texts were PDF scans with poor OCR (Optical Character Recognition) generated by outdated software. As a result, search engines—and by extension, the public—have had little access to the actual contents of Sidney Rigdon's writings during this critical period.

### Historical Context
These documents shed light on a pivotal era in Latter Day Saint history, specifically the succession crisis. They detail Sidney Rigdon's perspective on:
* The succession claims regarding Brigham Young and the Twelve.
* The introduction of "Spiritual Wifery" and plural marriage.
* The "Cochranism" controversy.
* The murders of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.
* Allegations of adultery and "secret priesthood" activities in Nauvoo.

By modernizing these transcripts, this project aims to make this primary source material accessible for historical analysis, search indexing, and academic research.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The data is organized into "sets" based on the date they were processed. This allows for version control as OCR methods improve.

## 🤝 Call for Volunteers (Verification)

**Current Status**: *Verification Phase (Jan 2026)*

I have created a complete 24-issue, 384-page transcription set (`jan-5-2026`). Before making these widely public, I need to verify the text accuracy against the image scans to ensure historical fidelity.

**How to Help**: If you are interested in reviewing the text against the original scans, please check the Issues tab or contact me directly. We are comparing the files in `transcripts/` against the images in scans/.

## 🛠 Usage & Data Format

The transcripts are not just raw text; they are structured data designed for modern usage.

*    **Format**: JSON objects containing Markdown text.

*    **Metadata**: Each entry includes the publication date, page number, issue, and volume.

*    **Application**: This structure is optimized for AI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, allowing LLMs to cite specific historical snippets without hallucination.
